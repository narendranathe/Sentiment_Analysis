For those of us that are older and came of age during the 1960s and 1970s the museum gives a portrait of Nixon's entire life, with the triumphs and failures. We too often focus and mistakes and shortcoming that overshadow a life that on the whole improved the life and opened opportunities for a nation. It was fun with the kids showing the various items that were iconic 1960s and 1970s, such as phones, tape recorders, etc. If brought back memories of the civil unrest over the Vietnam War, I still recall my draft lottery number from 1972. Nixon's opening of China was especially interesting with a pictorial exhibit of Chinese cities in 1971 and currently. Don't miss the Nixon Birth House a 1913 \"kit house\". The docent lead tour is excellent and a great eye opening experience for the youngsters. Well worth the day to relive an amazing period for American history during the 1960s and early 1970s. For the kids sit them in the Presidents desk in the Oval Room and remind them they can achieve great things through perseverance.\n",

I was anxious to learn more about him, and the library and museum do a great job of starting with the scandal, but leaving that in the past as you learn more about what Nixon accomplished as a political figure. He was known as a peacemaker and opened many foreign doors that others could not begin to reach. The grounds and home are beautiful and although it’s on a much smaller scale than The Reagan Library, it is very much worth taking the time to visit. It is mostly videos, pictures and script on the wall. Not as much memorabilia as at other libraries we’ve visited, but still nicely done. \n",

They loved it that a family member was on site and we were there .All the volunteers yesterday were great and gave us new information we hadn’t got on trip there few years ago.Sorry because of the government shutdowns that we couldn’t see full library and museum that was sad that the government congress get paid so much more money and get so many plus medical services and so on cannot do there job So America is running at its best . If we all didn’t do our work or job right we be fired no if’s and but’s about it. Congress needs to stop this ever few years the shutdowns get the job done that your paid for so much for better it be for your ,our country . To many people with out services that are needed like medical care and service and other services.We have been to four presidential locations told in Missouri,Iowa,and two in Ca.

I voted for Gesrge McGovern, knowing McGovern had no chance to win. I rejoiced when Nixon resigned. Then the rest of my life intervened, and I watched the third or fourth resurrection of whom I now believe is one of , if not the most remarkable, international strategic statesmen of the second half of the 20th century, when everything is objectively considered. The genius of the Nixon library is that it tells this story in a remarkably entertaining way, heralding the many domestic and foreign successes of his administration, as well his Shakespearan tragic flaw, which led to his ultimate downfall but resulted in his final phoenix- like resurrection as a geopolitical genius. The library also brings to life the untold life-long  love story of Pat and Dick Nixon. Finally, a visit to library also includes a tour of the house where he grew up and the helicopter that brought him home after his resignation. We had a wonderful emotional visit as we relived our experience of the Nixon years. We attended his inauguration and I shook hands with Henry Kissinger at Nixon's second inauguration.\n",

So many things that I remembered, but a lot that I had forgotten.   A complicated man.  We planned on spending about 2 hours here, and spent 4.   Even then, we had to go through some rooms quickly that I would have liked to have spent more time in.   For instance the rooms that showed his youth, were towards the end, and we went through those pretty fast.   Highlights were sitting at the desk in the Oval Office (and taking our pictures), and going through Marine One.

            "content: The Museum is very engaging, telling its story in a smoother subject flow than encountered at the Reagan Museum. It is easy to forget the many things that President Nixon did to help our country; he must have been doing something right, as when his reelection of 1972 was over, he had won the electoral votes of every State, but two. All of this is shown in the Museum. As noted in other reviews, the many docents were definitely appreciated. The house and helicopter are standouts. My wife and I were never alone in the display rooms or outside. There was always one of several guys wearing tennis shoes with red shoe laces looking at a display and imitating the slowest reader, ever. We noticed this for over three hours. Another surprise was not being able to take pictures inside the helicopter; because it is still owned by the military. That 1960 technology must be amazing stuff.A wonderful Museum; time passes quickly.\n",

            "content: I grew up having bad thoughts and memories of Nixon.  I didn't want to visit the Nixon library but my husband did.  Boy was I wrong.  Either I was too young or too self centered to realize all the turmoil in the world and how many positive things came out of this administration.  The presentations were first rate.  Looking back at Nixon's life from childhood up to death was fascinating and each of the rooms were devoted to specific time spans or events.  The helicopter was not available the day we visited.  The trip thru his original birthplace with the furnishings still in place was not as good as I hoped because you couldn't actually see all the rooms.  But still good.  I expected to spend at most an hour.  If you are interested in history, or politics, or want to see what went on in the world during this time, you can easily spend several hours here.  There is a tiny snack bar and a gift shop.  The staff/volunteers are nice and knowledgeable.  The rose garden was OK but take a look if you want to have an event here.  This is not a good place to take kids tho.  They will be bored.  Wheelchairs and walkers are OK.  Most impressed with the actual size replica of the Circular Office at the White House.  How cool.\n",

The exhibits are modern, fair and informative and cover the turmoil of the years leading up to the Nixon presidency as well as the achievements and mistakes of the presidency and how Nixon coped with life after resignation. The information presented was comprehensive and even-handed and I learned a lot. Of course, there is also quite a bit of information about the Vietnam War and Nixon's domestic policy (Title IX! Clean Air Bill!) and lots of background information about his early life. The outdoor area, including a reflecting pool and rose garden are gorgeous and peaceful and the Army One helicopter is not to be missed.

I loved the old school phones to \"listen in\" on various conversations. I thought it was unique to view his presidential moments first before going back and looking at his life as a young man before becoming President. However, it felt too new and impersonal. The one section that intrigued me was La Casa Pacifica, and I wish that it wasn't roped off, but instead a place you could sit and see the view from the couch as Nixon saw it, and perhaps have a guide/ interpreter stationed to discuss his life and answer questions. I wanted to take the bronzed dog off the seat and sit down myself. I also wish it was a four sided room with a door, not three sided room, so you could get a more immersive experience. Definitely a place with room for improvement and growth.\n",

This large museum is built right next to the house where he was born and lived the first 9 years of his life.  The house has been restored and the Nixon family made sure it looks just like it did when Richard was a boy.  On the grounds of the Museum (in the rose garden) are the graves of Pat and Richard Nixon.  Adult tickets were $16 and the place is open from 10 AM to 5 PM.I toured this interesting museum with a couple of friends on a Wednesday morning and really enjoyed walking through this interesting Museum.  Highlights were Marine 1 (the Presidential Helicopter) and the graves of Pat and Richard Nixon and Nixon’s boyhood home. The home still has the original furniture as the family put it in storage for decades and brought it back when the Library opened.  Make sure you watch the 15 minute movie in the theatre right next to the Library entrance (it’s also pretty interesting.)  Overall I really enjoyed this Museum and recommend it if you are in the area.  I am a history buff so probably enjoyed it more than others.

The video correlates with the overall layout of the library, as well.  The library does a great job walking through each year, major event, and/or crisis of the Nixon presidency - and his life leading up to and after his presidency.  A few fun thing to do: Visit the home President Nixon's father built and the family lived in for 10 years.  The house sits on its original property, and many of the articles inside are originals.  Visit the Marine One helicopter.  President Nixon took his last flight on this Marine One helicopter following his resignation from office.  You can enter the helicopter but cannot take photos.  Lastly, purchase a Presidential Library passport in the gift shop and get it stamped.  And take it to all of your future presidential library visits! \n",

            "content: We visited the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum on a trip to California in July 2017. We enjoy visiting presidential homes and libraries, and this one was worth the time spent there. Since we aim to see as many presidential homes as possible, this one provided the double benefit of seeing Richard Nixon's actual birthplace as well as the library that commemorates his life and work and provides resources for researchers. The museum is thorough and sophisticated, with rooms and displays that provide insights into all eras of his life from birth on. There is good film that gives an overall orientation to Nixon and his life's work. The film helps interpret the museum displays. As is the case in all presidential libraries/museums, there is a need to offer an interpretive lens to view the person's life. Richard Nixon has many living family members and individuals with whom he worked who needed to be interviewed and whose opinions had to be considered in developing the exhibits and an interpretive framework. So museum directors always walk a fine line between praise and honesty. The Nixon Museum is no exception. Because I lived through the ups and downs of the Nixon era and remember it well, I appreciated the Watergate exhibit the most. It was honest and thorough, if a bit too text-heavy, though that is hard to avoid with such a complicated topic. The museum curators did not whitewash Watergate, and I respected that truthfulness. Some of the other exhibits gave a more positive picture of Nixon's legacy in foreign policy and domestic issues, perhaps a bit too positive in some cases. I thought Pat Ryan Nixon could have been portrayed more fully. Instead there were exhibits on her clothing and shoes that needed a better interpretive framework. My favorite displays included videos of the Checkers speech, campaign speeches, and the resignation. These probably resonated with me because I remember many of them. I also liked the full-scale reproduction of the oval office during Nixon's tenure. The actual helicopter that whisked Richard and Pat away after his resignation is on display at the site. It is easy to envision him standing in the copter's door with both arms up and fingers of both hands making victory signs. I think the most poignant part of the visit was walking into Nixon's birth home, a small, white kit cottage that looks like a doll's house. Originally it had no bathroom, and one master bedroom. Nixon and all his brothers (one is still alive) slept in the open, attic-like room upstairs.I thought the docent who was present to tour people through the home that day displayed little enthusiasm for his work and just \"mailed it in.\" That was a bit disappointing. But the house told its own story. Nixon did come from humble roots.  Richard and Patricia Ryan Nixon are both buried on site.The library has a gift shop and a cafe service with simple meals.\n",

We are from Scotland and have limited knowledge of American politics.  I thought the museum was fabulous. Very different from Reagans obviously but just as good in its own way.  It is in a lovely building and felt like a more personal place to be given that his family home is there and you can walk right up to Nixon and his wife's gravestones.  The Vietnam section seemed to us to be an honest account of what happened at that time and was really moving.  I had no idea how bad Vietnam was and how many died.  We also enjoyed the presidential race section - good amount of visual and written information.  The China section good too and the Watergate bit which was quite complicated did not paint Nixon in a good light - which I thought was a good thing considering it is his library! We got on board Marine One which he flew in when he resigned.  Staff were really helpful.  We spent far more time here than we had anticipated doing (around 3.5 hours).  Only thing I would say is that it is a lot of reading and you do have to concentrate.  I think it might have been good if there was a video running outlining a few more of the events in nixons career as I felt my teenage daughter losing interest.  Overall though we thought it was really well done and we came away knowing far more than when we came in.\n",

The museum had a good balance of the events during that chaotic period that made Nixon popular and also what overshadowed his administration.  The darker events like Watergate and Viet Nam overshadowed some of the positive acts that we benefit from today such as Clean Air Act, Title 9, EPA, OSHA, opening relations with China.  The museum contained his birthplace (very well preserved), Nixon's resting place and the best was the helicopter that he left DC in.  Gardens are lovely.  Docents excellent.

The one regarding the international trips of the First Lady is very good. There are plenty of photo opportunities and clever presentations, such as picking up telephones to hear actual recordings between Nixon and public figures, such as one in which he tells Bob Hope to send him a telegram so he doesn't miss Hope's TV special.The museum tour begins with an outstanding film and also includes beautiful grounds that lead out to Nixon's boyhood home and final resting place. Regardless of you political views this will be a special place to visit for anyone.Perhaps best of all are the docents, who are full of good humor and interesting anecdotes.

The Nixon Library is beautifully maintained, understated but not simple, just very well done and thoughtfully put together. There is a short film at the beginning if you want to watch it, but we chose to by pass and get right into the library itself. Starts off with the end of the Kennedy/Johnson administrations and what our country was going through in the late 60's with the Cuban missile crisis, Vietnam, segregation and MLK, and then segways into Nixon's run for presidency, his win, etc. Lots of interesting and educational items to see and read about and of course a virtual copy of his Oval Office as he had it. You can read different letters written to him from parents and people pro & against the Vietnam war, A nice size area regarding his trip to China and I believe the 1st President to ever visit there. Also nice size section regarding Watergate and all that involved. The layout of the library is an easy walk around and there is SO much to read and see not only about his presidency but also Pat Nixon and all she did and life in the White House, etc. Outside is the beautiful rose garden started by Pat Nixon and also their burial area. There is also a replica of the small home Nixon grew up in. It's an excellent library! Well worth a stop and visit. Very informative and its a shame that Watergate overshadowed everything else he had done. There is a list of everything he accomplished on the wall by the Space/NASA area and China. Admission is $16 for adults but they offer a AAA discount. Bathrooms are also inside however there is no cafe or any place to eat or get food there. Plenty of parking and its free. We saw \"Marine One\" in an area beside the parking lot but we didn't see how or where you can go see it so it might have just been a display. Don't miss this - you don't have to be a Republican to enjoy a look back at our history.\n",

Politics aside, if you can get past Watergate, you can appreciate all that Nixon accomplished, such as OSHA, Title IX & the EPA.  Exhibits were very interactive and made the museum much more interesting.  Docents/volunteers were excellent and very informative and went out of their way to explain the exhibits.  Also informative was Nixon's home where he was born.  Well worth the visit.\n",

For better or worse, Nixon accomplished very important legislation and policies, especially foreign policy. It is all spelled out in this museum. Take your time to review each section. It took us about two and half hours to see it all. And this was on a Thursday afternoon, there were I bet 10 people there. Be sure to see the house he grew up in, the Marine helicopter near rear of property, and of course the gravesite. Been to several Presidential Libraries, I rate this the second best so far. Only Reagan's a few miles away is by far and away the best.\n",

The ceremony was outside where the grounds were meticulously manicured. The weather was perfect and the gazebo was beautiful. The reception dinner was inside a beautifully appointed ballroom. This is such an elegant venue with superb service! I highly recommend visiting the museum and if you should ever need a venue for an event, consider reserving a ballroom at The Richard Nixon Library and Museum.

The exhibits were first rate and the docents very helpful. We planned on maybe an hour at the Library, but ended up staying for almost 3 hours.  The grounds outside were beautiful and his boyhood home charming.  The exhibits brought back so many memories of my pre-adolescent years and the end of the Vietnam War.  I really left with a sense of who Richard Nixon was and his love for our country.  I was pleased to see that Watergate was very well represented and factual. No sugar coating.  After this visit, I can't wait to visit more Presidential Libraries.\n",

The helicopter area was closed due to the temperatures.  Now, 4 years later, we returned. WHAT A SURPRISE! The museum was overhauled, modernized and revamped. It was even better than before. It had interactive displays and was great for all ages. The outside gardens and areas were still just as tastefully done as before. An added bonus was the clean, well-appointed rest rooms. I highly recommend this for all ages, and groups. GO, spend some time, and enjoy.\n",

            "content: In the wake of the last election, I decided to visit here back in January to learn more about our country's history and i really enjoyed my visit here! As an Orange County native, I've always known the Richard Nixon was born, raised and buried in Yorba Linda, but had only come here once for an event when I was little. This was my first time seeing the museum itself and it was fascinating. There is a lot of data and information to absorb and it was really cool to see all the historical artifacts like Nixon's notebook sketches, childhood home, and the tools used during the Watergate break-in. The replica of the Oval Office during his time in office had great attention to detail also. The docents were friendly and knowledgeable and helped present an entertaining and informative experience to people of all political affiliations or lack thereof (I lean towards the liberal/progressive side). I never did feel alienated for not sharing Nixon's ideology, so I appreciate the museum's non-partisan outlook. Overall, I cane away with a greater understanding of the man and agreed with some of his major achievements (ending the draft, lowering voting age, National Cancer Act, Title IX, EPA, etc.) I look forward to coming back in the future!\n",

It's well worth a visit to explore an exceptionally important chapter in America's history.  Don't miss his birthplace and the lovely gardens on the grounds behind the museum.\n",

The cabin itself was cramped but was equipped with a presidential toilet!Upon entering the library is a huge picture of the former president with the \"Presidential Seal\" in front of Nixon's portrait.Of course there is nominal fee for access into this historical museum.  The place doesn't really have an \"actual library of books\" but is told in murals and other static display, which is well presented.  From actual calls between Nixon and our astronauts to letters written to the former first lady is on display.There is also a short movie of Nixon's early life and his rise to the highest office in the land. The rose garden is beautifully decorated with the hundreds of roses and the final resting place of the former president and first lady. We paid our respects and continued our tour.We took a guided tour of Nixon's original 990 square foot home where he was raised with his \"four brother's\" and about some of his hardship to his rise to the presidency.We we're told that Ohio Govenor, John Richard Kasich was arriving in town to pay a visit. Overall the price of admission was well worth the tour.\n",

I have never been a \"Tricky-Dicky\" fan, but I went along with it.There are plenty of exhibits about Richard Nixon and a very thorough discourse about his entire life, including some moving correspondance between him and his wife Pat.Our docent was kind of a jerk. She said we weren't allowed to take pictures, however, there was no signs that stated we couldn't. When she wasn't looking, I took some anyway. The entire docent tour and everything shown at the museum, is understandably pro Richard Nixon. Even the section on the whole Watergate travesty is minimized. It's probably a more enjoyable place for people who think he was a good president as it reflects a very pro-Nixon stance. However, for those who are more objective, it's obviously more of a propaganda tool than anything else, in my opinion anyway. I will say that the grounds are very beautiful and well maintained.

Can you determine how much of his complex life was based on his childhood?  Well, give it try.  Knowledge gives you great understanding even if not forgiveness.For those of us who lived through the birth of the EPA, the opening of China-US relations, and Watergate, we get insight. ( I especially enjoyed listening to the 18 minutes of missing voice on the tape.)  For those who were not a part of that period, it is an eye-popping revelation.  Does this museum/library explain the man's actions?  Only a psychologist can answer that, but for me, the experience helped to understand what he knew and how history can repeat itself.  Watergate into DNC vs tapping into DNC electronically?  Hmmmm.It would have been nice if a better refreshment choices were available.\n",

            "content: My husband and I have lived in Orange County for almost twenty years and had never visited this famous museum and library. We had some business in Yorba Linda in the early afternoon and a dinner in the early evening, so we searched for something to occupy our time in the area in the interim. There isn’t much, but there is the Nixon Museum and Library. As much as it seemed like it would be a challenging experience for us, since we are presently, again, in the midst of a challenging political environment, we were curious how the museum would handle the Watergate fiasco that Nixon was involved in. Much to our surprise, the building offered a very honest presentation before, during, and after Nixon’s stay in the White House. One can even read and listen to the evidence surrounding the Watergate case.The museum is well laid out, winding back and forth through many rooms. There are: many historical photographs, display case collections of gifts that he and Pat had been presented with over the years, display panels which highlighted various actions he had taken, statues of some famous political figures that Nixon dealt with, several phones which could be picked up to listen to many different important calls that had been handled during his occupancy, and large walls that showed maps of the countries with wars and challenges where the U.S. was involved in. A theater presents a good introduction to the museum, there are lovely gardens to walk through, of which also have his and Pat’s graves, the house his parents lived and he grew up in, and even the helicopter that he used during his presidency.I only have one criticism, which took away from the experience, the audio. Audio recordings play in all of the rooms, some with music, but many with ambient sounds, such as war time sounds, applause and cheering, and people speaking. When walking between each room the audio tracks overlap, which cause a conflict for the listener, as one continues through to the next room. The audio was far too loud to enjoy the overall effect, and it greatly took away from the ability to read the hundreds of written words upon the walls and displays, and listening on the phones. The audio does not add to the effect, it takes it away. I found that it got so challenging that I had to cover my ears to block out the sound from the last room, the present room, and the room to come, just so I could focus on the words before me that I was trying to read. They need to lower the audio sounds in every room, or the attendee will need to beware and take earplugs. Or maybe I am misunderstanding what was meant for the visitor? Perhaps the cacophony of sound was meant to represent the challenging time and exigent experience he had as the president?\n",

It is very user-friendly and pulls no punches about the former president's controversial life and political career.  With many interactive features and installations, the walk around the library which includes a replica of the Oval Office can be done in an hour or so if you wish.  His birthplace and the graves of both his wife, Pat, and him are on the grounds.  Yorba Linda is fairly accessible if you are in Orange County, California, or even LA.  It's only about 35 miles from downtown LA.  Long Beach, home of the Queen Mary and a fantastic aquarium, is nearby, as well.  The exhibits in the Nixon library pulls few punches about Watergate, the burglary coverup that eventually forced his resignation.  But it also highlights his progressive domestic agenda, including the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, his signing of the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, and Title IX, which created equal opportunities for women in sports and education.  Republicans in Congress now are trying to undo all of those things!  And, Nixon was considered a conservative in his time!  Amazing!  In any case, if you are in Southern California, the Nixon Presidential Library and Museum is a fine addition to your trip.\n",

On arrival you are greeted by a magnificent  huge wall painting of the president and a huge depiction of the presidential seal on the floor of the entrance hall. In the recently remodeled halls you can follow the life and political career of Richard Milhouse Nixon from his early days in his original home situated adjacent to the museum through to the Watergate Scandal. A very honest depiction of events  is presented. There is a beautiful long waterway surrounded by flower gardens which you can stroll  through to visit the aforementioned house of his birth. Adjacent to the house is the final resting place of both Nixon and his wife pat.Also on view  near the house is the Marine 1 Sea King helicopter nixon used in his time as president. Facilities are wonderful with  disabled access, restrooms and a very nice  coffee shop.In an interesting and educational way,i found out there was much more to this  man than i had imagined. He was president in my lifetime and should be remembered for his wonderful foreign policies and not just the sad ending of his presidency over water gate. A pleasant few hours can be spent here immersing yourself in a very important period of American political history.\n",

The Nixon library does a very good job of presenting a balanced view of, probably, one of the most complex presidents, in terms of Nixon's psyche. As you may expect, you will learn about all his foreign and domestic accomplishments, that are often overshadowed by Watergate. Watergate does NOT get short shift in the library, actually this was the most popular, crowded section of the library. There were many visitors that were not alive in the early 70's, so this audio, visual intensive room was packed with details. My husband , who had not read any books about this period, was mesmerized by this section.  For a library that has just been recently renovated, I was a little disappointed in the layout: no apparent restroom detours along the long labyrinth of displays, no cafe, room temperatures were too cool, had to keep my coat on, Displays start with Vietnam move chronologically to Watergate, then goes back in time to his birth and early family/political life.\n",

All of them have been interesting reminders of the times we lived in and the problems they faced - socially, economically, politically and internationally. The Nixon library recently underwent a major renovation that greatly improved the library. They added a replica of the Oval Office and unlike some replicas of presidential libraries you can enter it to examine the furnishings or to sit at the presidents desk for a photo shoot. The library is located by and includes his boyhood home as well as a replica of the East Room and some very nice gardens.Most remember Nixon for Watergate and know little of his good work with China, setting up the EPA, his interest in national health care, his work in winding down the Viet Nam war, etc. He was a complex man with many flaws, but he also did a lot of good work. The library has done a good job covering all facets of his accomplishments - the good and the bad. The Watergate coverage did not sugar coat that mistake and provides good coverage of it.The negatives of a presidency are remembered long after the good works are forgotten. All presidential libraries I have visited are good reminders of the totality of work of those they honor and provide a welcomed, renewed perspective.If you have an interest in politics, visit one - you will be glad you did.\n",

            "content: I'm old enough to clearly remember the sixties and watergate. As a high schooler I worked for Eugene McCarthy. I voted for McGovern the first time I was old enough. Still, I had visited the Regan library and enjoyed it although I was not a fan of his either. So, Given a free morning in the area, I spent 2 hours at the Nixon library. I didn't know what to expect. Talking to some of the docents I found them to be pretty pro Nixon as one would expect, but I was generally pleased and impressed with the museum.  They were in no way hostile to the presence of a Democrat and I has very pleasant conversation with several. I had wondered if it would whitewash Watergate but it did not. It was thoroughly critical. It didn't suggest why he did what he did but I guess we'll never know. It documented the conspiracy in great detail and didn't spare Nixon in any way.The timeline of the museum was peculiar. It started with the sixties and then went into his 1960 campaign, his loss in 62, then his wins in 68 and 72, and then watergate. After that it went back to his early years and then after 74. The museum as a whole was more complimentary then I'd have made it but it was in no way out of line. For we democrats it emphasized that under his terms in office the EPA and OSHA were enacted. In conclusion I'd suggest it to anyone. While I was there there was a high school field trip present. Most looked bored but at least they were respectful. If you're interested in American history from the twentieth century you should go, regardless of political orientation.\n",

The museum follows policy themes home domestic social space. All is well documented and displayed. I particularly liked  listening to the phone calls to spaceThe tour also includes the small house he called home. Which was fascinating and the guide exceptional. We also visited the presidential helicopter which had a nice padded roof and orange seats.  A great afternoon and well worth a visit Nixon will forever be remembered for watergate but he accompanied lashed so much more \n",

Visitors view Nixon's lifetime of work - impressive albeit flawed.  There is a good mix of artifacts, videos, interactive media, photos, and narrative. Some of the labels are not completed, though, but there were a number of informative docents who could fill in any gaps caused by missing narrative.  Having Nixon's boyhood home on the grounds (where it has always stood)  underlined how far he rose from his humble beginnings.  The helicopter he used as transport is also on the grounds.  We were pleasantly surprised that the National Parks Pass provides free admission to the museum!  There are other discounts available; military, senior, etc.\n",

Gives a good insight into our 37th President, his complex personality, but an open insight into the accomplishments of his Administration.  While much of the Presidency was overshadowed by Watergate, the public is made aware of the really positive accomplishments.  He was a well informed President on not only Domestic Affairs, but accomplished much with his international relations, China, Russia, etc.While Richard Nixon was a private person you leave this Library learning what a brilliant and knowledge politician he really was.  The man rose from a disasterous situation to become a most respected and knowledgeable elder statesman.  He became an advisor to several sitting presidents.  If you look at his domestic programs while in office you will see much of his influence in today's polices.  Whether popular or not he left a rich legacy.  This is a great environment for those interested in politics and is especially a great place for school age children participating in history and civics,\n",

The historical presentations are dense with information and sprinkled with videos and audios. There is a 10 minute movie that introduces the visitor to Nixon. It took me 3 hours to get through the exhibits. Also on the Library grounds is the original house where Nixon was born and spent his youth. The Library is on the site of the original Nixon residence. Richard and Pat Nixon have their final resting places on the grounds. The Presidential helicopter is also on display. I was at the Library on a Sunday and there was a free concert, so check the schedule before you go. Parking is free and ample. There is no food or beverage service at the Library. Cost of admission is low. The Library fairly represents the Nixon presidency, good and bad. \n",

            "content: Just visited the new, improved museum.   But time has passed and the entire collection of Nixon Tapes and Papers (his words both spoken and written) have been available to scholars since 2011, and therein lies the my title.      \"One Man Against the World\" is a must read prior to visiting.   It is NOT available in the gift shop (sadly, the picture of Nixon with Elvis has been removed).   Tim Wiener's team read through these documents and produced a well written and foot noted history of the Nixon Administration.    All of this based upon the spoken and written words of President Richard M Nixon.Unfortunately for the visitor, especially younger visitors just beginning to explore history (and maybe learn from our mistakes), the museum remains mostly an all out effort to spin the Presidency of Richard M Nixon into what it was not.    In the museum there remains no mention of Nixon's veto (written by Pat Buchanan) of the Child Care Bill of 1971 (a bill that Nixon favoured, but he bowed to GOP pressure and vetoed).   There is no mention of the 1968 pre-election talks between Nixon aids and Vietnam President Thieu that sabotaged Johnson's peace talks and prolonged the war.    There is no mention of Nixon's directions, followed to the letter, to Kissinger to portray him (Nixon) as mentally unstable and ready to launch nuclear weapons.  There is no mention of an exhausted and mentally ill President, who, giving President Nixon his due, recognised he had scuttled his own legacy as well as the honour of the USA.The museum could provide an education in the rise of an intelligent man and his failure due to hubris.    Instead, it serves only to spin a fantasy about a President who offer the USA much to learn from.\n",

We have walked through the ruins of Pompeii in Italy and the Alhambra in Spain speculating what it must have been like to live there at that time.

            "content: As a youngster during the Watergate scandal in the early 70s, most of the news one heard of Nixon was very negative. However, through reading and a visit to this beautiful library and museum, one can really learn about Nixon's tremendous contributions to history.  The grounds are wonderfully maintained, and walking through the actual home (and location) of his birth and where he lived until age 9 was a literal travel back into time.  Docent led tours of no more than 10 people are the only way to see inside the house.  Virtually all the furniture and fixtures are original.  Nixon himself visited the site in 1990 to help direct placement of the furniture.  It is easy to imagine young Nixon reading by the fireplace, playing the piano, and playing around with his brothers.  The Nixon home originally sat on an approximately 8 acre parcel.  A few feet from the Nixon home are both the gravesites of Richard and Pat Nixon, as well as one of the Presidential helicopters (Marine 1) used by Nixon.  I look forward to visiting again when the Library and Museum are open again after the current renovation.  Until that time, visitors to Yorba Linda can still have an enjoyable visit to the site.\n",

            "content: The museum was under renovation when I saw it. They reduced the admission price to just $6 because most things are closed. It was definitely worth this admission price. The movie is good, about thirty minutes in length. Make sure you see the grave site, the rose garden, walk in his birthplace with a guide, and visit the presidential helicopter which I bet some people don't see because it is at the far end of the property just after the birthplace. I thought the inside of his birthplace was especially interesting since it was a trip back in time to how people lived in the early 20th century. Regardless of your politics, I think you can get something out of this museum even though it is not as spectacular as the Reagan library and museum. Of course, the Nixon site is a lot closer to most places in LA so for most people it is more conveniently located and takes less time to do.\n",

            "content: On a spur of the moment, I decided to head over to the Presidential Library and Museum.  What a wonderful surprise! I spoke with some of the docents there, learned a lot about President Nixon through the docents, as well as through the film they invite you to watch.  President Nixon was quite the man's man, as well as an accomplished musician.  I know most will remember him because of Watergate,  but I'm glad I was able to learn much more about the man.  The museum is currently undergoing renovations, so I was not able to view the entire museum.  However, I was able to view a replica of the White House East Room, in the White House weddings and dances with dignitaries and much more were held in the East Room.  Take your time walking the rose garden as it is quite lovely, and there are roses named for some of the First Ladies, and as they say, stop and smell the roses, you may even find the plaque dedicated to Vietnam Veterans in there.  Walk through President Nixon \"REAL\" boyhood home.  The docent informed those of us who walked through the President's boyhood home, that the home was built from a kit, and the Nixon's had 5 boys all born in the home.  President Nixon lived in this house for the first 9 years of his life.  He also learned to play the piano, the violin and the clarinet there.  You will even be able to see the original instruments that President Nixon played, along with families original furnishing.  There is a California pepper tree next to the home that President Nixon's father planted there in 1912.  I learned fascinating history of President Nixon through the docent!  You can also board Army One/Marine One, the helicopter used by 4 Presidents.  The docent explained that the helicopter has 2 names depending on who the pilots were at the time the President was in the helicopter, Army or Marine.  A very interesting fact.  My final stop in my visit to the Library & Museum, was to the final resting places of President Nixon and First Lady Patricia Nixon.  The museum will re-open in October 2016 to view all that I was not able to see this time around.  This is a wonderful place to spend some true quality time, and to really look at everything, as there is so much to see.  During my visit there, there was a young couple practicing for their wedding.  So with that, I also learned that they hold weddings and other functions at the Library!  A wonderfully beautiful and fascinating location.  The history of our 37th President born on this land, the President and First Lady laid to eternal rest here, and quiet beauty that is here.  Well worth the visit!  Wear good shoes and bring your camera!\n",

Both of these require the escort of a guide who explains the basics of what you're seeing. The grounds, while not extensive, are lovely and we enjoyed the walk.

            "content: Inasmuch as Nixon had his haters, he was a native son of California and had a respectable life before Watergate struck and killed his political career.Nonetheless this place is fascinating. It provides an insightful look into Nixon's roots, his service as a US Navy contract attorney, and his immense political career that predated his presidential runs in 1960 and 1968.He had many progressive ideas that are often overlooked these days or overshadowed by the demise of his 2nd term as president. Sadly few Americans have ever taken the time to know and understand a tragic figure in American history.The museum boasts an incredible collection of Nixon artefacts, nostalgia, informative documents, and a wide array of knick knacks connected to him, Pat Nixon, his family and his marriage and death. Former Pres. Nixon and former First Lady Pat Nixon lie side by side in well appointed graves outside of the main structure, in a quiet area between the museum and Nixon's childhood home which had also been moved to the grounds.Nixon's childhood home appears well-preserved and boasts the musical instruments his parents and siblings played to entertain themselves in a time far-removed from the white noise of today's technologically advanced society. The family of Nixon's childhood appears to have been rooted in the concept of the nuclear family, with much love and devotion.The presidential helicopter (reputedly shared with President Kennedy as part of the White House legacy) is present and you may tour its interior but may not photograph the inside.Inside the museum you will find the presidential limousine, and many articles and memorabilia underscoring Pres. Nixon's push to enact legislation expanding Medicare, Medicaid, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and a host of other programs aimed at improving foreign affairs and ultimately reducing nuclear arms proliferation both among the advanced nations, and emerging third world nations.Entire areas are devoted to Nixon's warming of relations with mainland China and the SALT Treaty negotiations, as well as covering tough historic debates centered around the Uruguayan Round Table agreements, the \"Nixon Shock\" which resulted in a wage and price freeze to halt runaway inflation, the Oil Crisis of 1973, the legalization of private ownership of gold bullion, deregulation of certain former war-time industries, and last but not least, the truce in the Vietnam Conflict that brought our POW's home, and ended American involvement in that segment of Southeast Asia. Though not entirely neutral, the museum curators have done an excellent job of displaying a segment of American history that spans the beginning of WW II and Nixon's earliest roots in public service, his many political campaigns, his crusade against communist infiltration, his vice-presidency in the years 1952-60, the 1960 and 1968 bids for the White House, his 1972 landslide re-election, his tenure during the Apollo moon landing,  to his final days after his resignation, including recreating his study where he passed so many years later and wrote so many books and handwritten letters to his friends and family.If you take the time to see how much is displayed there you can appreciate that Nixon's public service was not in vain, and despite the greatest cloud that any president could ever have hang over him, he was a man who lived a life far less ordinary by any standards.As with all tragic anti-heroes, he was a man with many flaws but an immensely human individual. I hope those who go to this place will set aside any enmity towards Nixon and try and view it through the more positive perspective.If you do go, please also spend some time in the gardens, you'll find they are rather nice to hang out in.Next to the museum/library is a park. It is dog-friendly (as was Nixon) and is quite accessible for those who want a place to bike, walk, take their pets and enjoy.\n",

            "content: My wife and I visited this in CA when we were here.  Sad to say, it was under renovation. :( Glad to say, price was vastly reduced!!! $8.25!!!  :) The theatre presentation alone was worth the price! It was very educational and informative!!  Richard Nixon was overall awesome!  And then we saw the funeral plat of RN and Pat AND the house where RN was born in 1913!!! Yes it's still there!  Worth the $8.25, but we will be back in when renovation is done!!!\n",

Added to that, and on this particular day the East Room 'display/recreation' was closed due to a private event.  Still, it was more than worth the time. First, there is the Helicopter that serviced Nixon, as well as Kennedy, Johnson, and others.  Also his birthplace is presevered, including the furniture inside.  The gardens are beautiful.  The Library is simple yet elegant.  Regardless of your politics, it's interesting, historical.  It a nice change of pace from Disneyland, Knotts, Etc.

Maybe this is temporary.The highlight of the visit is the wonderful birthplace house and gardens containing President and Mrs Nixon's graves.   Unfortunately the house and presidential helicopter - the very one he left the White House for the final time in - were both closed due to some light rain but for this the admission fee was waived, which was appreciated.Still it was great to ponder a major figure in global political history and spend a quiet moment contemplating in the gardens.I would strongly recommend going after October in order to maximise your experience.\n",

In spite of the controversy, there are invaluable contributions associated with the Nixon Administration.The facility is relatively compact and easily viewed in two hours. However, the library and museum are under renovation till the fall of 2016. Still, there is much to see. I started by viewing the replica of Buzz Aldrin's foot steps from his lunar landing. Moving outside, it was a stellar day to see the gardens, including Mrs. Nixon's roses. The tour of President Nixon's home was brief as the house is small. Our docent, Carol, was informative and  very knowledgeable. Moving onto Marine One, I toured the helicopter used for the president, first lady and staff. As a point of interest, it is the same helicopter used by Presidents, Kennedy, Johnson and Ford as well. Our docent there was Ruth who was also interesting and very knowledgeable. The twenty eight minute theater presentation is definitely worth your time. It highlights President Nixon's political life including all highs and lows and his numerous political comeback. A great family or school outing. A must for any history buff living in or visiting Southern California.\n",

There is nary a mention of the shameful end to his presidency, but it was good to be reminded of the good things Nixon accomplished: an end to the Vietnam war and thawing relations with China and Russia. Especially instructive in the context of this crazy election. Very respectful and mostly informative tribute to the Nixon family.\n",

There is the helicopter to see; some exhibits that are not being redone; and the childhood home.    There is also the fountain and garden area as well as the final resting places of Mr. and Mrs. Nixon,There was also a memorial to Mrs. Reagan in the lobby area as she had recently passed.It was fun to see.The staff in the gift store area where one purchases admission were awesome.The volunteer who does the tours through the Reagan childhood home was awful and grumpy.  Oh, well...I had seen it before so just tuned her out.  It was still good to see the childhood home and worth one's time.  I was there on a Tuesday morning.My rating as average is due to my recent visit and the fact that currently not that much to see.  The former exhibits on our first trip were awesome, so hopefully with the new exhibits when it reopens my rating would go up.\n",

And while I have visited the Library/Museum many times, one of the best deals going is it's free Sunday afternoon entertainment.  There is a variety of talent, from classical to ragtime, a cappella choirs, pianists and ensembles.... It is FREE!  Note: It does include entrance into the library itself.  But what a great date.  Doors open at 1:30pm and the event starts at 2:00pm  It has a beautiful theater and is very intimate.  Needless to say, it is first come, first serve.  There are no reserved seats.  You can pay to visit the rest of the library or head over to some local eateries for treats or dinner afterward.  There is Baskin Robbins, just east down Yorba Linda.  Or for a healthier treat, try Yogurtland, where you can build your own.  Yogurtland is located on the opposite side of the street, west on Yorba Linda Blvd in the Sprouts shopping center.  For dinner try Fitness Pizza and Grill, Mimi's Cafe, Chili's, Polly's Bakery Cafe,  Tio Chava's for Mexican or Epic Noodle for Mongolian BBQ.  You can also head down to our new Whole Foods on Imperial and Valencia.  They have a huge variety of prepared foods and you can eat right there!  And if you're in the mood for fish tacos, in the same center as Whole Foods, you have got to try Slap Fish!\n",

Suggestion is to go to that first then house then the Library / Museum.  The Customer Service aspect by staff was lacking with no discussion of problem solving. This is management issue and made me sad that such an iconic President and his final resting place couldn't sort out a mid day issue with visitors coming from so far away (we had been told Marine One was part of tour).  Cost was small but it is the point. We, most likely, will not be back.

There are a total of thirteen libraries recognized by the National Archives and I’ve seen three of them so far. In my travels around the country, I started to make a point of visiting a library if there is one nearby. Nixon’s library was under renovation it just so happens and an entire wing was not available for viewing. Instead, we spent time at the helicopter (Marine One) and the house where Richard Nixon was born. As I learned, the house was built from a kit that Sears and Montgomery Wards sold in the early 1900s. As the story goes, Nixon’s father bought the kit and assembled it on a few acres of land that the family called home. Notwithstanding Nixon’s legacy, the trip was worthwhile and we plan to return when the expanded version opens in September.\n",

The building itself is very nice with a welcoming entrance and fountain. I was taken aback about the location in the middle of a residential/retail area but then after finding out that this was the original location of his birthplace it made sense. The major exhibits are was not open due to the renovations, but it seems like they could have moved the exhibits into the other existing areas of the building while the renovations were taking place. However the grounds were open and the gardens were very lovely, the reflecting pool was very nice leading to the gravesite which was very dignified and very simple, reflecting his Quaker upbringing. There is also a replica of the East of The White House which is impressive. His birthplace/home was nicely restored and quite nice. The helicopter is on the grounds and worth a look. All in all even with the exhibits under renovation I found this Presidential Library far superior to the Reagan Library in Simi Valley. \n",

I honestly doubt it will be that drastic of a visual change when completed, but still something to note that it may look different later.  There was a section which had a recreation of the East Room of the White House, so I doubt that would change.The property used to be part of a large orchard which was owned and maintained by the Nixon family for years.  While much of the original acreage has been parceled off and developed (which was not uncommon), there was enough space available to place the VH-3A Sea King presidential helicopter, and the house which Nixon was born in.  Take as many pictures as you want inside the house, but none were allowed on the helicopter.  Nearby was a flower garden, which presently didn’t have anything blooming, and the burial sites of President Nixon and First Lady Patricia.Inside the main complex there was an exhibit brooches worn by Secretary of State Madeline Albright during her term of service.  Each brooch had a particular theme she was trying to convey during the situations she was in.  No pictures were allowed of the brooches.From there, there were sections on Nixon’s early career, from pins from his terms in the House of Representatives and the Senate, and the unsuccessful presidential bid in 1960.  A statue gallery contains likenesses of various leaders who Nixon interacted with, and next to that is a room which contains a testament to Nixon’s work on improving relations with China.  There’s also a piece of the Berlin Wall there.  Beyond that is a whole section dedicated to Patricia Nixon, and then one focusing on the space program.The last portion had the presidential limo, and a breakdown on the events of the Watergate scandal which has led to Nixon’s resignation.  We arrived at the museum just as it opened, and by the time we’d gone through all of these sections we were ready for lunch.\n",

I was a bit hesitant to pay the entry fee, $6 for adults, but glad I did.  They do have different pricing structures for students, children, etc.  Nevertheless, I was proven wrong to be hesitant upon entering, and we were unable to see everything the site has to offer!  Having never been interested in studying Nixon prior to this visit I was pleasantly surprised by the exhibits highlighting his entire life, including his pre-Presidency Senate years.  We came originally to pay our respects at his and Mrs. Nixon’s gravesite, which is located within the grounds of the site.  To visit the gravesite, you must pay the admission fees.  At first I was a little disappointed I would have to pay $12 (for the two of us) for the right for two American citizens to pay our respects to one of America’s former leaders.  This originally seemed less democratic, more capitalist, but it end up being well worth it.  We paid for the right to pay our respects, but received a tour through this American giant’s life for free.  His birthplace and burial site are both included in price of admission!  We were even able to tour the very helicopter he famously left the White House in those iconic images following his resignation.  There was a small part of the museum off-limits temporarily due to a private event.  We could have waited to view it, but we were quite satisfied with everything else the site offered.  All of the docents (museum volunteers who serve to educate the public) were informative, polite, and welcoming.  We went just after lunch on a weekday.  There was ample parking in the lot and few visitors inside, allowing us plenty of time to view the exhibits.\n",

            "content: The Nixon Library will probably be a truly outstanding venue when the renovations are completed (was told at least a year from now), but right now it is mediocre at best. When we arrived, we were told that most of the exhibits were closed for remodeling but since we were there we went ahead and purchased tickets. They discounted the price due to most of the museum being closed - discount coupons or senior pricing will not be honored during the renovations (to add insult to injury, they could accept cash only as their credit card processing equipment was down). All of the in-depth exhibits that cover his political and Presidential years were closed. You can, however, watch a 30 minute overview film, tour his birthplace, board the Presidential helicopter, view the gravesites (they were not ringed in flowers as on the brochure) and walk inside the replica of the East Room. There is one display that chronicles a timeline of his life and in the foyer there are many photos of events that took place in the East Room of the White House. The East Room chandeliers, ceiling and walls are absolutely beautiful but as a totally empty room, it loses some of the majesty of the original. The First Lady's Gardens were a disappointment but a docent explained that it was at the end of the blooming season and state watering restrictions have caused the grass to die in spots. I sincerely recommend you wait for the renovations to be completed.\n",

Gotta say -- the Nixon library was very honest and presented Nixon's Watergate fiasco as well as his great accomplishments.  (Note:  very much in contrast with the Reagan library which was grand, but did not present anything negative, i.e. his reaction to AIDS crisis).  Anyway, having witnessed the Watergate hearings growing up, I was prepared for a glossy coverage of Nixon's life and presidency -- but was pleased to see everything presented fairly.  His poor upbringing and struggles, his childhood home, opening up China, as well as Rosemary Woods erasing the tape.  For anyone interested in history this is a must see -- Also beautiful lovely setting and grounds.\n",

            "content: This will always be special to me because this was the venue for my daughters wedding. As you might expect, it was very pricey, they married on lawn in front of reflecting pond, the East Room (replica of White House), used as Reception area. Could not have been more lovely. However, it was the Caterer's not the Library Staff that made it the spectacular event it was. We were given a list who could cater, thankfully we chose the \"Anaheim Whitehouse\". The \"Wedding Coordinator\", we met only on the day of the wedding. She did nothing for us except advise last minute what we could not do, we had rose petals scattered on the white carpet the wedding party walked down, we were told to clean up the pedals after the ceremony. Really, that was not included in costs, the next incident I recall was when the Bride and Grooms Limo left with them, all of the guests that were outside saying goodbye were locked out of the Library by the night guard, who refused to let us back in to even retrieve our belongings, if not for the guests still inside we would not have gotten back in. Most unfortunate incident, so while I would highly recommend this as your Wedding Venue, I would definitely address concerns up front. Now this wedding was 4 years ago, so hopefully they have improved on their short comings. Another thing I would like to stress is, the guests were kept busy by visiting the museum as well as the helicopter and home Nixon's father built. I might add, you don't have to be a fan of Richard Nixon to hold your wedding here, I certainly was not. It is a beautiful place that will remain forever as your Wedding memories in posterity.\n",

They gild over the dirty tricks he pulled from his first campaign on.  They make his Checker speech sound brilliant, when it was an act of a desperate man.  I don't think he did much as VP.  His defeat to Kennedy was blamed on dirty tricks.  As president he did some very good foreign policy things.  He did lie about troops in Cambodia and air attacks there.  Even if all the other acts he did were great the lying about Watergate makes him a looser.  The exhibit are laid out in a confusing way.  I found my self starting at more recent panels and reading backward. I think this is a place needed to be visited to see how hour form of government can survive a crisis.  And it did work.

            "content: We (6 of us) spent 3 hours here, and could have spent much more time.  The library is nicely laid out, and there are volunteers/staff spaced throughout the facility to answer questions or assist.  Being old-timers, we remember well the Nixon presidency, but we were all surprised to learn how much we did not know about him and his life.  There is also a very nice exhibit concerning his wife, Patricia.  As mentioned in earlier reviews, there is an exact replica of the East Room, which contains historical photos of major events in the White House East Room.  There is also one of the presidential helicopters, Marine One.  This is the one that Nixon took when he left the White House in 1974.  Nixon's original birthplace is on the grounds, still in the exact spot where it was located in 1913 when Nixon was born.  In order to enter the house, you need to wait for a \"tour\", which is a docent/volunteer explaining the history of the house and the family.  This was the only experience which was disappointing to us....the docent of the day was apparently in a big hurry (although there were no other people waiting when we went into the house).  There are lots of pictures and documents hanging on the walls which would have been nice to see, but we really felt as if we were being shown the door almost as soon as we walked in.  The gravesites of the President and First Lady are in a lovely spot on the grounds.  A hint: if you have a National Parks Pass, you can use it for the Nixon Library (but not the Reagan Library).  We were told this was because the birthplace is on the grounds of the Nixon Library. If you enjoy history at all, you will love the time spent here.\n",

            "content: That old campaign slogan applies to this Library, museum and birthplace as well.  The Nixon Library and Birthplace Presidential Museum is the one presidential library started and administered by a private Foundation until 2007, when the National Archives started administering the place.  It is built at the birthplace of our 37th President and the home where he was born is in its original place on land once the Farm and ranch of his father, Francis Nixon.  The house is an excellent example of a 'mail-order' house typical of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  It is open to tours as is the Marine One helicopter nearby.  Nixon and wife Pat are both buried within fifty feet of the birthplace home.  The library is a bit smaller than most, because there is a lot of material that still resides in the National Records Offices back in Maryland.  But the Museum itself is beautiful, complete and honest.  There are galleries on the early years, the 1946 election to Congress, the Senate, the Vice Presidency, the 'wilderness years of the 1960s, the 1968 election, Vietnam, the opening to China, the Mideast conflict, the Soviet Union and Detente, the Space Program (Nixon, not Kennedy was President when they landed Apollo 11 on the moon), life in the White House, domestic affairs (5)3 1973 old crisis, price controls, leaving the gold standard and founing the EPA) and yes, Watergate.  The gardens and surroundings are beautiful and there is an exact replica of the East Room of the White House, but no Oval Office.  The East Room replica can be rented out for weddings and other functions.  There is also a very homey replica of Nixon's Favorite room - his den!  There is a gift shop and a very small cafe serving basic drinks and sandwiches.  Open Monday through Saturday 10 am to 5 pm.  Sunday 11 am to 5 pm.  Adult admission $12.  Wheelchairs available on a first com, first served basis.  Advice: parking can be a challenge here, so best to arrive early.  Take California Freeway 91 (Riverside Freeway) to exit 36.  Go north on Imperial Highway at the end of the ramp to Yorba Linda Boulevard.  Turn west (left) onto that street and the Library and Museum Grounds will be on your right.  Enjoy!  \n",

I highly recommend visiting this library.  There is so much history and memorabilia.He grew up in the smallest of homes and his buried along side his wife, Patricia no more than a 5 second walk from his birth home.  The library does not sidestep the Watergate scandal.  There were few visitors when we arrived that one of the guides took a few of us for a walk to talk about his life and some of the nuances in the library.  It is also very well priced.  Bring your AAA card if you have one.  Enjoy going back to the 70s for a few hours.  It is so worth the time.\n",

The library itself was a fantastic record of history during Nixon's time, Watergate hearings and life size statues of Chou En Lai, Mao and several others.  Of course, there is his oval office and the room reserved for Watergate Investigations and his famous picture bidding goodbye with victory signs. What I liked most is his modest home which we were told that it is the exact replica of Nixon's home where he was born in Yorba Linda, exactly the place where his library is located.

Everyone has to go thru the gift shop going in and out of the museum and it is staffed with nice and friendly personnel. There was an exhibit of Madeleine Albright's pins inside the museum when I went there and it took me a while to get to the rest of the museum. The original house where President Nixon was born was behind the museum, same thing with the burial grounds of the ex-president and first lady. There were replicas of the Lincoln room and East room but not of the oval office. Gifts from various Heads of State were also displayed.

            "content: My husband and I went to the Nixon Library last Saturday. It is a beautiful property with the library and research in one building and then a walk through the garden to his birth home and burial site of he and his beloved. A little walk further and you'll find the historical helicopter that he flew away from the White House after resigning as president. There are a couple of notes about visiting this attraction. First, I highly recommended you to view the movie prior to visiting the exhibits. One of the wonderful docents greeted us as we walked in and he showed us the map of the entire area, giving us advice as to how best view the place. He didn't tell us about the movie, which we almost missed. Fortunately, as we were preparing to leave, we stopped to speak with another guest who excused themselves to go into the movie. We followed and were so happy we did. It is a must-see movie and will make the visit to the rest of the property make much more sense. The movie taught me so much about this special man and the way that he lived his life after his presidency. It's not a long movie (maybe 30 minutes). My second note is that you'll find this library to be a bit simpler because of when it was built. It is a lot of reading about the history rather than interactive exhibits. Give yourself plenty of time. There are many special gems as you walk through. Be prepared to read if you want to get a good sense of the history of this president and his journey. It is well worth the effort.A side note:  this is a beautiful location for a wedding and they have a huge building very elegantly fashioned to have the reception.\n",

The movie theater with the video was being remodeled but they had it playing in another area. Another nice touch of this library was that his birth home is also on the property which was nice to take a tour of. Lastly they had a helicopter which was neat to walk in. Great visit overall if you enjoy presidential libraries.

This year, we decided to visit the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and it was well worth the visit.My children range in age from 17 down to 11.  From the time we arrived until we left, we spent well over three hours viewing the various exhibits the library has set up.  My children particularly enjoyed the letters from young Nixon supporters after he lost the election of 1960.  I appreciated the way the library put a more human face on Mr. Nixon, while recognizing that he made some very serious errors of judgment in the Watergate affair.  All-in-all, though, this library is a very worthwhile stop on your visit to southern California, especially if you are a U.S. history buff - plenty of stuff to keep you interested for your entire visit.\n",

Its like Clinton excluding Monica, or Bush Katrina. However I can now say it is more comprehensive as the Watergate portion has been expanded and includes an in depth look into the events that took place from all sides. Tip if you get there early go straight to the birthplace, it allowed us to get a more personal tour before the crowds arrived. Having been to L.B.J.. Regan, Clinton and W. Bush museums they are all worth a visit. If you are in Orange county do not miss out on this gem!\n",

            "content: I am already planning a return visit, although the museum is laid out so that you can spend as little or as much time as you like exploring. Nixon's childhood home and helicopter were chained off for events or other tour groups and the wing on Watergate deserves more of my time. There is such a plethora of information and exhibits, great for all ages. The grounds are blooming with flowers and many award-winning roses in Pat Nixon's rose garden. A piece of the Berlin Wall is in one of the rooms, all of the exhibits present information you may not necessarily expect, and the graves of Nixon & Pat are in the garden. I learned so much about other countries and how the US has fit in with major world events. I loved seeing the gifts other countries gave Nixon & his wife as well as his personal family life. My eyes were opened incredibly. My next visit will include time in the extensive museum store and I am going to look into spending some time in the library itself. I am a nerd who loves history and museums and this is definitely near the top of my list. Not a nerd? Visit anyway. Even if you do not read anything, the photographs alone are incredibly fascinating and tell an amazing story. Politics are left aside and that makes it an even greater visit. I saw a number of memorable quotes, including one on New Year's Goals inside and about love on Pat's headstone. The inspiration I gained by going there will be with me for a long time and will definitely remain a positive impact for me. Enjoy your visit!\n",

It's not that I wouldn't pay for it, it's just that I love a bargain and who doesn't like something for free!Be prepared to spend several hours here, there is a lot to take in and it's well presented in various forms - short movies to watch, listen to the phone taps, sit by the reflecting pool, smell Pat Nixon's roses, climb into the Air Force one helicopter to name a few. Now you don't have to be a Republican to enjoy this museum (but I'm sure it helps!), but I think it appeals more to the Baby Boomers who grew up in the Nixon era. My mother from Northern Ireland was well impressed by it. My kids love it for the history on Nixon and the well presented exhibits surrounding his time, and hey, who doesn't love to see a part of the Berlin wall?  I always get a kick out of the gowns worn by the Nixon women. Allow time on your visit to enjoy the reflecting pool and rose gardens, see the resting place of Nixon before taking a chance to stop by the house he grew up in. This is a lovely flashback of life in early 20th Century (young girls will love the reproduction model of the house located in the main building). Last stop should be to see the Air Force One helicopter, it's fun for kids and adults alike. There is a small café and a gift shop offering plenty of educational things to buy.It's a little bit off the beaten track for most tourists, but it's close enough to Disneyland that it might just offer an out of town family some history and culture that they will always remember.\n",

The library and birthplace were excellent exhibits and I enjoyed visiting the gravesite of his and Pat's.  Interesting point, in California, burial on private land is illegal and the library sits on private land.  Therefore, a nearby church had to purchase the land for their graves.\n",

The library did a wonderful job of presenting the end of the Vietnam War, the Space Program and the political landscape in our country from the late 1940's until the early 1970's.  Included in the tour was coverage of the Kennedy/Nixon debates and the close relationship between the Nixon's and Dwight Eisenhower.

I enjoyed the movie which started the day and explained much more about Nixon and his politics and political career than I knew, enjoyed the exhibits, enjoyed seeing the home he was born in (built by his father), his helicopter, and the beautiful gardens. Additionally, when we were there (May 2015), there was a rotating special exhibit about NASA space suits which was interesting! It was $12, which is less than the other Presidential Library I've been to recently, and we spent 2.5 hours wandering around (easily could have spent longer if we weren't hungry!). It had great stories, great artifacts, and great history. The grounds were beautifully kept and you can tour both the house he was born in and his helicopter with a docent. Definitely worth a visit for Presidential and history lovers or someone just wanting to learn about a slice of life in the 60's and 70's! The only con was the cafe -- we were expecting some sort of restaurant, but the cafe was more like vending machine food with sodas, candy bars, etc.\n",

            "content: I am a bit of a Presidential junkie in that I have read biographies on all of the U.S. Presidents, visited many of their former homes and also have visited 8 of the 13 Presidential libraries.There are many positive things to say about the Nixon Library. First, his childhood home is on the grounds, in the same location as it was when he lived there as a youth. A docent takes you through and you see many of the original furnishings. The helicopter that Nixon flew to Andrews Air force base after resigning is also on the grounds, and you can walk through with a docent.There are beautiful gardens by a reflecting pool and many benches to rest on as you walk to the President and Mrs. Nixon's graves. Their headstones are very simple and surrounded by lovely box elders and flowers.The Library is a treasure trove for research since the Presidential papers were all placed here after Duke U in a very short sighted fashion refused them.  Then there are numerous documents and placards to read in the Museum..... Not all of them flattering to say the least. The Library has a political timeline, as do other libraries, and there are places you can watch TV broadcasts, such as Nixon's famous Chequers speech and also a debate with JFK in 1960. There is some whitewashing of course. For example, I did not see anything on Nixon's association with Joe McCarthy and his part in that witch hunting era. There is a section devoted to Pat Nixon as well.There is an entire section devoted to Watergate. I don't know what one of the other reviewers saw, but I thought it was quite comprehensive and pointed out lies told by RMN.The museum also contains areas replicating the Lincoln Sitting room and the East Room (although the floor in the East Room was being refinished and we could not go in). The study from Nixon's NJ home was there.There are also special exhibits and currently, it is on space suits. We only had time (after 5 hours) to make a dash through that exhibit.The cost to go through all of the attractions is very low. We paid $8.50 for senior rate. The gift shop does not overpower the experience, and we saw there was a small cafe on site. There is plenty of parking, and our GPS took us right there (a few signs coming off the highway as well). Overall, a good visit. We \"came of age\" during the Nixon Presidency and resignation, so it was especially interesting to see information from that era.Only suggestion is to add more interactive displays. For example, at the LBJ Library, there is a bank of phones where you may select conversations between the President and various people. With the taping system during Nixon's tenure, there should be a great assortment!\n",

It is particularly unique in that it bookends his life: the house in which he was born is there (original location), as well as his grave.  The house was interesting as it is very well preserved and includes most of the original furniture the Nixon family had while he was growing up.  This serves as an intimate setting that takes you closer to the man.  For what it's worth, I enjoyed it more than the Ronald Reagan library.The main exhibition of the library is interesting, as it shows an oft-forgotten side of Nixon.  He was a passionate, tenacious man, and very gifted communicator.  This comes through very well.Everyone knows Nixon for Watergate, and the library has a large exhibition on that subject.  However, it feels as if they treat the tragic event with kid gloves, eschewing  pointed critique of Nixon.All in all, this is a good, intimate library that helps you understand the man a bit better.\n",

What struck me as \"different\" was near the end when they provided a very balanced timeline and explanation of Watergate. Having lived through this time period and visited five other presidential libraries of the 13, I had never seen something like this done elsewhere. However, it helped one understand what caused his early departure from the presidency. I really enjoyed it because although you might disagree with Nixon's decisions, especially as they relate to his involvement in Watergate, you came away with a better understanding on how the decisions were made and the events that precipitated the Supreme Court's decision agains Nixon. I really enjoyed every minute and highly recommend this site to others. Nice job!\n",

We are not Nixon fans, but found this museum portrayed him and his presidency fairly.  The Watergate escapades were presented as they unfolded without spin.  The role Nixon played as a diplomat and internationalist was emphasized, as it should be, given that this was one of his finest attributes.  I thought that his early California political experiences were whitewashed, but I only know what I read in the papers.  The political and social times were beautifully recreated through news clips, TV kinescopes, and period artifacts, like his presidential car, an old \"woody\" station wagon used as a campaign vehicle, and the presidential helicopter.  We only had three hours there, not enough to do it justice.  The museum is in an out of the way location, near a large parking lot and shopping area, and one could miss it easily without GPS guidance.  It was only 30 minutes from our Newport Beach hotel by car.  Although hhis museum is not high tech, with a lot of push buttons and fancy displays, it is definitely worth a visit, and gave my wife and I a new found respect -- and pity -- for  President Nixon and his family.\n",

Nixon was president when I was in junior high school, and remember him the most for ending the Vietnam War and also WaterGate. But through the years, I have learned more about this man beyond those historic moments, and also been interested in the history of this period that I lived through but don't remember much about as a young person.We visited on a Sunday afternoon and were warmly greeted by one of the museum docents who suggested how we go through our tour. There is interesting history exhibits in the front of the museum about the Nixon family that Pres. Nixon grew up in, and a lot about his childhood, education and how he came to find himself in politics. From there, we were went through a recreation of the East Room of the White House where presidential briefings are done to this day. Onward to see his childhood home, which is actually on the property and a short tour is available to those whom are interested. I learned in that tour that Pres Nixon was very interested in being a musician as a young person!This location has the most amazing rose gardens and the landscaping and property is just lovely. We also learned that other well known politicians and foreign dignitaries have donated roses to this garden through time. There is a lovely reflecting pool as well and we learned the property hosts many a wedding or other special event. In the same area as the gardens, you will find the headstones and resting places of both Pres Nixon and First Lady Pat Nixon.The museum itself is so nicely laid out and focuses on the man and his rise and fall during his presidency. There are some great TV clips playing around the exhibits, and many more detailed exhibits around the NASA program, Vietnam, and things he did during his presidency, including the formation of the EPA (which I was very interested in having worked in the environmental industry in the past). There is a lot to see and after a few hours, we felt saturated and decided to leave.This museum also has a great little gift shop with Nixon type paraphenalia and some political books for purchase too. I was more than amazed by this museum which includes so much more than I expected including the museum and history itself, but the beautiful grounds, gardens, childhood home and rose gardens were such a lovely addition. There is something there for everyone. If you are interested in the man and this period of time, you should make a visit. I know I will be going back again for more next visit!\n",

If you want to see the interior of Nixon's childhood home, do a docent tour.  You do not get to see the boys room but the house has original furnishing, a small bathroom with a large metal basin for bathing.  It was nice to see that he was buried by his childhood home.   I enjoyed the grounds, house, rose garden with the roses named after every first lady, watergate,  vietnam war, the room right before watergate of what all he had accomplished including getting the vote for 18 years old who could go to war but not vote.

The most intriguing display consisted of life-size statues of world leaders with whom Nixon met during his peace initiatives. Statues were positioned around a room, making it possible to walk among groups of them, such as Churchill, Adenauer, and De Gaulle standing together.  It was interesting, and sometimes surprising, to note their heights...or lack thereof. The display of gifts given to Nixon by other heads of state was most impressive. Outdoors the retired Marine Helicopter used by three presidents was positioned near the restored home where Nixon was born. The docents were very helpful and knowledgable.\n",

            "content: We toured the Nixon Library & Museum on February 13, 2015.  It was a very interesting and informative experience.  We intended to arrive closer to opening time (10:00 am), but didn’t arrive until 11:45 am.  We had read reviews that recommended signing up for a tour guide, which we intended to do.  But, the next guide wasn’t available until 1:00 pm, so we toured the facility on our own.  I recommend arriving near opening time to be sure to get a tour guide.  We found the docents in various rooms of the exhibit gallery to be loaded with information about Richard and Pat Nixon.  If you don’t sign up for a guide, take advantage of their knowledge.  They are very ready to answer Qs and offer many little-known facts and stories about the Nixons.The first thing that strikes you when you drive up is that the facility looks very “presidential.”  It’s very classy in every respect.  The entire facility including restrooms was spotless.The tour path starts with a 20 minute video in a large theater, which is worth seeing before entering the Exhibit Gallery.  The Exhibit Galleries walk you through President Nixon’s life and presidency and also include Pat’s life history.  Though he had to resign the presidency due to the Watergate debacle, it was amazing to learn about how influential his political career was in many areas not always known by the masses.  I found the exhibit area about the NASA moon missions most fascinating.  Though Kennedy gave the charge to NASA, it was under Nixon that we actually made the first landing in 1969.  The videos that stream in this exhibit are worth watching.  The lead-up to Nixon’s groundbreaking trip to China was also fascinating.  The Watergate matter is displayed with amazing detail and candor.  Also check out the Lincoln presidential limousine, which has 2” thick glass windows.After the Exhibit galleries, you go to his birthplace and boyhood home which is on the back of the grounds.  There is a model of it just outside the theater, which is helpful to look over before touring the real thing.  It was a mail order house and is the epitome of space efficiency.  The docent stationed with the boyhood home does a nice job summarizing the house’s history and Nixon’s life in it.After the boyhood-home tour, we toured the presidential helicopter, which also included a well-informed docent.  Then, we toured the replica of the White House East Room.  A number of interesting events that took place in this room are documented on various displays.Our total time spent was about three+ hours.  If you take the time to read all the displays, you could easily spend the entire 10:00 am-5:00 pm museum hours there.\n",

            "content: This is the 6th of the 13 Presidential Libraries/Museums we have visited. Our clear favorite is the Reagan one, but this is in the next tier, along with the JFK one. It also contains beautiful gardens, the birthplace of President Nixon, and the final resting place of Nixon and his wife, Pat. The museum is thorough. It covers all phases of his service, in the House, Senate, VP and President. It also covers all of his campaigns.  There is very little on his early, pre-political life, something that may be addressed in the upcoming refurbishing. Highlights for us were the exhibits on foreign affairs, including the Caracas attack, the trip to China and the Russian negotiations. The Presidential limousine was very neat, and the hall of his achievements (war on cancer, the EPA, getting the voting age lowered to 18) was informative and impressive. We also enjoyed touring the Presidential helicopter. The grounds are impeccable, and the docents among the best we have found. My only nit is the overemphasis on Watergate, perhaps something that developed after the Feds took over from the prior, private version. It has to be examined, of course, but it is by far the biggest and gaudiest exhibit.But all in all, a great experience. \n",

            "content: Even if you aren't a Nixon fan, you will enjoy your time at this library/museum.  Lots of historical information & perspective.  While we spent a lot of time in the Watergate exhibit, there is just SO much more there to see and experience.  Having the library on the grounds where he was born (you can tour the actual house that's been restored) and buried is pretty cool.  The two White house rooms that have been recreated here are the Lincoln Sitting Room (smallest room in the WH) and the East Room (one of the largest & just beautiful - they rent out the room for wedding receptions).  I believe they are adding an Oval Office in a remodel in the next year or so.  We took a guided tour with a docent - and if you have to chance to do that  (they just post times they are giving them that day in the gift shop), by all means do - he pointed out so many small things we might have missed just going thru on our own - then after the tour we went back & spent more time in the exhibits that particularly interested us, as well as touring the outside gardens, the house, and the presidential helicopter (which was actually Army 1 at that time, rather than Marine 1).  Fair Warning - they say the tour will last an hour, but it will probably be more.....and that's okay, because our guide was just full of interesting facts & antidotes.   There is a small \"café\" off the gift shop where you can buy drinks & some prepackaged sandwiches - but you'd be better off taking your own food & having a picnic of sorts if you want food while you are there.  No real picnic areas, but there are benches outside by the reflecting pond....the 8 people in our group just 'tailgated' in the parking lot by the fountain.  We did both libraries during this trip (Nixon on Monday, Reagan on Wednesday), and I have to say I enjoyed this one more.   While Reagan is big & in a spectacular setting, it also comes across to me as too much of a \"money-making\" venture (huge gift shop, no private photographs allowed up to close to Air Force One & Marine One....so you can BUY the ones they take of you).\n",

The Library was closed, so we had to go back.  We are glad we did.  The Nixon Presidential Library is an important part of our history.  The facility and its presentations are impressive.  The Library addressed the good, the bad, and the ugly of President Nixon.  We forget the good things he did like creating the Environmental Protection Agency building a relationship with China.  The building itself reminded me of Nixon.  The home where Nixon was born and where he grew up is part of the site.  That proved to be one of the most interesting experiences.  When people saw the little \"tub\" that Nixon and his entire family used off of the kitchen, there were lots of comments.  His boyhood home demonstrates his humble beginnings better than anything.  If you are interested in United States hisotry or Presidential history, this is a must stop place.\n",

            "content: My wife and I have made the commitment to visit all thirteen Presidential Library Museums, sooo… we finally gave in to our obligation and made the trek to Yorba Linda and the Richard Nixon Library Museum.  Admittedly, this is an odd prelude for what turned out to be a worthwhile lesson in history.  Yes, each Presidential Museum is justifiably a “pep-rally” for the presidency at hand, but given the chance, one comes to realize the accomplishments and significant contributions of each presidential leader, no matter your personal feels, for good or bad.  If one is available, we encourage taking a guided tour led by a knowledgeable and personable dossier.  Our guide at the Nixon Museum, was thorough, articulate and well balanced in his presentation.  (We have discovered that dossiers with such gifts are extremely generous with their time and knowledge. An hour tour may well end up more like an hour and thirty minutes... or more. If you are not in a big hurry, it is well worth the investment of time.)  Some of the highlights include: early political aspirations, the vice-presidency under Eisenhower, Nixon’s loss to Kennedy, his subsequent election to the Presidency, and of course, Watergate (which was a surprisingly honest presentation).  Not to be missed is the post-Kennedy assassination limo designed for much greater security.  Also, we enjoyed the room featuring life-size statues of various world leaders with whom Nixon interfaced. (Other reviewers have offered some great photos that are worth a look.) After the tour, visit the boyhood home and the Presidential helicopter, both of which offer interior tours, worth your time.  On our tour there were among us some obvious Nixon fans and others prejudiced in other ways, but each of us learned something new about the challenges and leadership required of those who have lead your nation under all sorts of circumstances.\n",

Well, just yesterday, I took some family visitors from Minnesota to the library on a damp Friday and was surprised to learn how much I had been missing by not seeking out the several docents who man the place. Olga greeted us as we walked into the foyer and informed us of all the sights to see. We met up with her later at the Presidential Helicopter where she proved extremely knowledgeable, cordial and downright fun.  But the highlight of our tour was to meet Donald King, a docent who first warmed our hearts, then showed us the Nixon birthplace. We really were entertained by Mr. King and were especially in awe of his extent of knowledge about the Nixon family and Nixon's great influence on future presidents and the making of a better world. Because it was a slow Friday, we ran into Mr. King in two other locations and renewed our bond with him. My point is, because of these two docents, I and my party walked away with so much more than we would have on our own. So, my advice is to seek out the docents and don't miss seeing the Nixon Library.\n",

We both were surprised at how nice this museum is put together. Loved the presidents in baseball section. Of course the scandal of the 70's involving President Nixon made some people tell me it wasn't worth seeing. They are wrong and everyone should visit the Nixon Presidential Museum and judge for themselves. We found it very informative regarding all of Richard Nixon's life and the service that he did do for his country. Loved the childhood home of the Nixon's that is on the property and part of the admission to the museum. We did not get to see all of the museum and I was disappointed that we were seeing other attractions in the area so got to the museum around 3pm. It does take more than 2 hours to see everything and also read about the president. We will return on another visit to enjoy the whole display of information. Very nice staff volunteers. Small gift shop but bought a few nice things to remember a pleasant afternoon.\n",

I arrived just after opening on a Saturday, and had a good hour to walk around before I noticed a significant number of people.  One of the docents noted that the crowd was light for a Saturday … not sure if this was because of the Labor Day holiday weekend or not.  Four historical issues seemed to dominate most of the exhibit space: (1) Vietnam War, (2) Russia, (3) China, and (4) Watergate.  There are many important documents, interesting gifts from foreign dignitaries, campaign stuff, and photographic reproductions from key events in Nixon’s political career.  My total visit lasted about three hours, and I had no problem staying focused the whole time.  I would recommend a visit to the Nixon Presidential Library & Museum to anyone interested in politics, or who remembers world events from 1953 (Nixon becomes V.P.) thru 1974 (Nixon resigns office of the presidency).Following are my observations and tips:* AAA membership gets you $1 off the admission charge.* If you’re planning to visit on a hot day, get there early because the “tours” of the helicopter and birth home might close due to the heat.* I found the helicopter interior to be rather boring [sorry] because there is nothing in there that was even close to my expectations: a few seats with semi-plush fabric (covered by Plexiglas) and a red phone.  It’s also rather small … it takes about five long strides to get from the front door to the back door.  I think I spent one-tenth the time in the helicopter as I did listening to the docent beforehand.  If you want to take that “tour” (groups of 4-5, maximum) walk over there before the grounds get crowded.  [Note: photos of the inside are prohibited. No wheelchair access]* The tour of Nixon’s birth home is pretty interesting.  It reminded me of the Elvis Presley birthplace (Tupelo, MS), only bigger and better furnished.  [Note: photos ARE allowed inside]* I thought the movie in the theater (very comfy in there) presented a good bio of Nixon’s political life.* I highly recommend watching the archival videos of the Nixon-Kennedy debates in the main gallery.  Both candidates spoke so eloquently, intelligently and positively about their vision and plan for America.  And, they were so civil … no denigrating the opponent!  How I wish public discourse could be like that nowadays.* The presidential limousine—1967 Lincoln Continental—is cool.* Check out the replica of the Lincoln Sitting Room, and look at the photos of the way presidents Clinton and Bush had it decorated.  There’s also a replica of the East Room.* Buzz Aldrin’s moon boot tracks are in cement right near the reflecting pool; some say “don’t miss this,” but I say you can.  I saw many people walk right over them.* The burial sites are very simple and serene.* The special exhibit (Play Ball!) has fun videos of presidents throwing out the first ball, plus memorabilia including handwritten notes, special edition Louisville Slugger bats, autographed baseballs, paintings, photos and uniforms.  This is worth a visit.  [Thru October 5, 2014]\n",

He was the President that finally ended the draft, Nixon also administered the National Environmental Policy Act, and lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Nixon's home that he was born in still stands and 90% of the furnishings are original. A docent is in the home to talk about his early years, the home, his family and answer questions. Behind the home is the Presidential helicopter, a must-see. Fun to take pictures in front of. The garden is in bloom (summer has beautiful roses) and has tours, call or check website for times.

Located on 9 acres of land in Yorba Linda and surrounded by beautiful gardens the grounds itself are beautiful.  The entrance fee for adults is 11.95 and parking is free.  The gallery was very interesting covering RN's entire life and presidency.  Everything including RN's baseball collection, to the Watergate scandal, to the Apollo events.  It was filled with tons of information and interactive videos.  At the time of my visit, Nixon's childhood home was closed so unfortunately I was unable to go inside but it seemed to be very well preserved.  Walked through Marine/Army One, the helicopter used by presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford which was the highlight of my husband's experience.  The replica of the White House East Room is so beautiful and can be rented for events I believe.  The visit gave me a better understanding of RN's time in office and was a very enjoyable experience.\n",

            "content: If you like to read all the info in exhibits about history, then you need to plan to spend several hours here. They don't get to Watergate until the end of the labyrinth of a museum gallery, but I was interested in all the areas, even though I was not a Nixon fan. The whole thing is really well done. I particularly liked the little area where they posed life sized bronze statues of famous world leaders that Nixon worked with diplomatically and you can walk among them. In this same gallery were shelves of the most fascinating gifts given to the president by heads of states on official visits. Each item was chosen carefully by the other country as the treasured item they most want to bestow on the United States as a sort of tribute, in a way. So each country's choice was so interesting--the pride they showed in the workmanship of their artisans, or of their archeological history was something that I felt honored to see! It tells a lot about the world at the time.They also did a great job explaining the whole Watergate mess but it takes a lot of reading to go through it all. I am guessing most people won't have the time to stand to read it all in the displays.They have a nice little gift shop and the actual birthplace home Nixon was born in is preserved as it was, and a nice docent led us through it for about 15 minutes. The grounds are very nicely preserved. They do revere Nixon in a way that felt weird to me since he was the only president to resign in disgrace, so you get the feeling that he was such a great statesman-- and not much of his faults. To be expected. But we really enjoyed our afternoon here!\n",

Highlighting his foreign policy accomplishments, as well as his handling of Vietnam, a balance is struck contrasting the Watergate situation and resulting fallout. To see his childhood home, preserved to the time period as much as reasonably can be expected, along with Marine One, was really enjoyable, and served to put a face of humanity upon this former leader of the Free World.

            "content: I had not visited this library & museum prior to the National Archives and Records Administration(NARA) taking over the management of the operation and content in this lovely, open & inviting \"campus\" that is beautifully maintained and staffed by cordial and knowledgeable docents throughout. I had read about the controversies with regards to minimizing the negative aspects of Nixon's political career but I thought the only obvious evidence of this \"spin\" was in the introductory film narrated by Nixon. I thought that the information about Watergate was presented in a most objective fashion and was a great \"refresher course\" for me having been in my twenties when these events transpired. Being an \"old guy\" allowed me to only pay the senior rate(62+ = $8.50) for admission.The aspect that I found most positive about this library & museum was that one could have a most enjoyable experience breezing through in an hour or so or one could spend multiple hours concentrating on what might be of particular interest.The visiting exhibit last month was looking at the information & memorabilia of baseball & various Presidents. It was really interesting to watch the docent attempt to talk to a visiting school group about Willie Mays,Duke Snider & Mickey Mantle. I especially liked the jersey of the  Cuban National Team given to Jimmy Carter when he visited Havana and the jersey that George H.W. Bush wore at Yale with the accompanying description of how he had trouble hitting breaking balls!The Exhibit Galleries are extensive and well done. There are a host of diverse interesting areas of concentration that were of particular interest to me. Being a guy, I didn't spend a lot of time in the replica of the East Room or in the areas of the Exhibit Galleries dedicated to china, dresses & gowns, etc. I particularly enjoyed reading the history of Nixon's family that is along the wall nearest the Reflecting Pool in the huge room that you immediately enter into from the Gift Shop. Knowing this family history helped me better appreciate my experiences throughout my visit.The helicopter wasn't open the day I was there due to a problem with the steps but I did visit both the Grave Site & Birthplace.I really enjoyed the time I spent here last month and I think that the diversity of the subject matter of the enigmas of Nixon as a person and a political figure remain extremely interesting twenty years after his death.\n",

            "content: I have always wanted to go here, seeing the signs on the freeways for years. I grew up with this President, and was eager to learn more. There is much to see, and the museum and displays promote his life, his political career, his love for his wife, and his interests. All are informative and very well done. The 27 minute movie provides an excellent overview to Pres. Nixon and his life. Also included are his actual birth home, built on this exact site by his father, plus the Marine One helicopter he left the White House in on his last day. Both are open for tours by the excellent docents working on the property. Do not hesitate to ask about anything. And the museum does justice to the Watergate scandal, and the tapes, providing not only a complete timeline and biographical sketch of everyone involved, but they also allow you to listen to the recordings and also to hear the famous gap in the tape. The David Frost interviews are also presented in part. All of this is very well done, and we spent almost four hours covering pretty much everything. I was glad to have done it.\n",

But in addition, there were 2 White House rooms recreated, the presidential limo used by 5 presidents, presidential helicopter used by 5 presidents that you can walk through and be photographed coming out. Also, a gallery of life size statues of world leaders he dealt with that you can walk around and take pictures with, the small house where he was born, a beautiful reflecting pool and gardens. And the auditorium, normally with a video, had music on Sunday. We really enjoyed it, and ran out of time so blew right by the Watergate exhibit which looked really interesting. Gotta go back. Also, the night before we watched the movie Frost Nixon which got us in a good frame of mind :) and the staff was wonderful! We used a wheelchair and everything was very accessible.

We have been to the FDR in the Hudson River area, Kennedy in Boston, and several others that are not in the National Archives management system.This library captures the poles and all of the corners of Richard Nixon's some times sensational and eventual downfall through his own actions.  The building is attractive inside and out. It is well maintained by the Federal National Archives. The gift shop is a first stop before you enter.  Budget about 3 hours here. First stop is the movie theater where you see the broad spectrum of the president's life including his accomplishments and his downfall due to the Watergate scandal.The exhibiits coverage begins with Nixon's upbringing in a quaker family where we was taught the value of hard work . (You can tour the cottage he grew up in the cottage behind the library and you can get a guided tour of the cottage).  All of the accomplishments of Nixon's young life are well documented.  The tour also thoroughly covers Watergate and Nixon's downfall for authorizing illegal acts that resulted in the criminal prosecution and conviction of so many of Nixon's top advisors.  One leaves this building finally with a sense of awe of Nixon's abilities and the feeling of loss over what might have been accomplished if he had not authorized and covered up what the courts have essentially labeled criminal conduct on his behalf by top assistants.\n",

            "content: We had been planning to visit the Nixon Library and Museum for several years, but Yorba Linda seemed out-of-the-way.  We finally made the trip in January and were glad we did.  We have been to several other presidential libraries/museums and we found this one perhaps the most interesting.  Whereas I found the Reagan Library/Museum to be overtly propagandistic (although certainly worth a visit), I found the Nixon Library/Museum more circumspect with a factually detailed history of Nixon's life, from early childhood to his death.Both President and Mrs. (Pat) Nixon are buried on the grounds with simple headstones.  The grounds outside the museum are easily walkable and nicely groomed.  The outside highlights are Nixon's boyhood home and the helicopter that he used for his departure from the White House after resigning.  The docents guiding our visit provided interesting comments and offered to take our picture standing in the door to the helicopter.There are many interesting exhibits throughout the museum - one of my favorites was on the \"kitchen debate\" that then VP Nixon had with Russia's Nikita Khrushchev at a Worlds Fair exhibit in the USSR.  The museum's exhibit shows a replica of where Nixon and Khrushchev verbally sparred, and a small, B&W TV on the counter replays the actual \"debate\".  Another of my favorites was on Nixon's first trip to China, truly a historic event.Plan on 2.5 hours to see everything - we only allotted 2 hours and had to rush through the Watergate section, which may have been the most interesting.  Or you could start with the Watergate section and skip some other section if your time is limited.There is a gift store and light snack bar near the entrance.  I thought the gift store had lots of right-wing propaganda (books especially) that were not representative of the actual museum.  There are better restaurants within a few blocks.  Overall this is a highly worthwhile attraction to visit.\n",

            "content: My wife, 2 daughters (7 & 11) and I were in So Cal during Thanksgiving week, and having just spent two days at Disneyland, we wanted to do something a little different.  My wife & I had been to the John F. Kennedy museum earlier in November, and thought it would be interesting to see what the Nixon museum had to offer.  We drove up from Anaheim and it took about 25 minutes to get there.  Directions to the place are clear and it was easy to find, I was a bit surprised to see that the museum is just down the street from strip malls and surrounded by residential housing.  Not that it detracted from the experience, but surprising nonetheless.  There is a huge parking lot out front, and the property is lined with large trees that provide a buffer from the suburban encroachment.You buy tickets at a register at the entrance of the gift shop, not really well marked, you could just wander in to the museum through the gift shop, but we figured it out.  We started out watching the film introducing President Nixon, it provided a lot of good information although the kids started getting fidgety at by the end.  We then proceeded to the exhibits which overall were well done.  It was hard not to compare this museum with Kennedy's, and unfortunately Kennedy's was better in terms of the building, content and layout.  We really liked the China part (my wife is originally from there), and they have the actual cage that was used to transport two pandas from the US to China after Nixon's historic visit.  The 1967 Lincoln Continental was unexpected and was really cool to see.We left the museum to go see the graves of the President and First Lady which are very close to the house President Nixon was born in.  We went through the house on a guided tour (pretty quick, small house, cannot wander around or go upstairs), and then went through the helicopter.  Both very interesting and enjoyable to see.  Two things that the Kennedy museum did not have!We are glad we took the time to visit this museum.  Even though the kids were a little bit bored, it was a worthwhile place to visit and would recommend others to do so as well.\n",

And some of my favorites: a hall with exhibits discussing the Watergate Break-in, Nixon tapes and Nixon's resignation; a room with life-size statutes of world leaders that you can walk among and 54 covers from Life magazine that Nixon was on (more than any other person).

But when I ended up having more time than I thought, I decided to check it out. I'm really glad that I did. Being only 25 years old, President Nixon's term was well before my time. Before I visited the museum, all I really knew about him was the Watergate Scandal. While the museum definitely covers the Watergate Scandal (in a very objective manner I should add), I was more impressed with Nixon's other work that often goes unnoticed. The museum did a great job at highlighting his work in Congress on the Alger Hiss case, which I knew very little about. It also gave great information about Nixon's work on improving foreign relations (specifically in regards to the Middle East and China). and ending US involvement in Vietnam.In addition to the great learning opportunities, the museum has a number of other highlights including:-his birthplace/childhood home (which was built by his father)-his burial site-Army One Helicopter-only full-scale replica of the White House East Room in the world-beautiful gardens and reflecting pool-Presidential LimoIf you are in Southern California and have a day (or even an afternoon) to spare, check out this museum...you won't be sorry.\n",

Be prepared to spend time reading the printed material at the exhibits.  We arrived early enough to walk inside the Presidential Helicopter - they close it because it just gets too hot on some days.  We walked through his first house - he was actually born at home.  His father built the house from a kit and is a great bit of Americana.  All of the docents are friendly and informative. It is a shame that the only thing most people remember about President Nixon is Watergate. Did you know he started the EPA and is one of our \"greenest\" presidents? I strongly suggest that you visit the library if you are in the area. I do not recommend it for young children, they might find it a little boring. But for adults and teens, it is worth the time and admission price (which is very reasonable).\n",

It is interesting to see how the domestic and international affairs that originated during the Nixon era have grown today. The museum includes the senatorial, vice presidential, presidential exhibits, a piece of the Berlin Wall, space exploration, which all took place during the Nixon years; the museum surrounds his childhood home next to his resting place, encompassed with the formal gardens and reflecting pool that are well maintained. The original helicopter that President Nixon left the White House in, sits toward the back of the property. The National Archives are down the elevator on the lower level, and the Research Room is available to anyone who is interested in visiting.\n",

            "content: The Nixon Presidential Library & Museum is an easy drive from San Diego, Los Angeles or any location in Orange County, CA, but it was personal recommendations from friends that prompted our visit. It was definitely worth it. Located on the former site of the Nixon family's small citrus farm, the Library is set among handsome gardens and even includes the delightful 100-year-old family home. Touring the Library/Museum, one gains a better appreciation of Nixon's historic trip and reopening of American contacts with China, the release of Vietnam POWs, the Apollo 11 moon landing, and his contributions as a fully-engaged vice president. The exhibit devoted to the Watergate controversy is excellent, glossing over nothing. There are re-creations of the Sitting Room off the Lincoln Bedroom & the East Room. (We were privileged to see it set up for a wedding reception.) Docents are abundant, friendly, knowledgeable. There's just a small cafe on the grounds, so we chose to have dinner on the way home.\n",

I went into the Nixon library with a biased view of the man. I read about him and  I saw Frost/Nixon and made  snap judgements of him. First of all , the facility is Top Notch! He really is beloved  by Californians. He had an extrordinary life. I am only sorry I judged him on one singular event and not his whole life. If you love the history of our country and your within a hundred miles of Yorba Linda, go see it. You get to walk inside his childhood home (Amazing). The helicopter that took him to the Airport and home is there. His and Pat's graves are in a beautiful garden area.  Very Modest compared to Ronald Reagan's. I went through both and although the Reagan Library is just as impressive, I  got more out of the Nixon Library (both worth Seeing). He really was a good President. He had all of our interests at heart. If you asked me that before i walked through his library I would have said he was a crook. I didnt feel like that when I left . He was a decent man and I am glad he was our President. Seriously go check it out . You'll be glad you did !\n",

The setting is lovely and the material interesting.  Nixon obviously was a very complicated man and figure which the museum covers nicely.  One neat exhibit had life size figures of influential leaders during Nixon's time.  You also got a nice sense of his relationship with Pat.  If you are in the area, it is definitely worth a visit.\n",

Not much about his childhood or his family, although his boyhood home was very interesting.  They had one of the Marine One helicopters there, which are always interesting (there was also one at the Reagan Library).  There was a hallway dedicated to Watergate.  Although I actually remember Watergate, I was too young to understand it at the time.  Other notables from the library – it gave Nixon the credit for getting the U.S. out of Vietnam.  He was the first President to sign a treaty with Russian (SALT I) that limited the use of weapons.  And, he also is credited with opening up trade with China.  Always worthwhile to absorb pieces of our nation’s history, but this museum didn’t knock me out.\n",

It will peak your interest if you were around during this period, but if you weren't born yet or too young to remember it may not interest you (unless you are a young political history buff).There are some interesting sights and good picture spots like the house Nixon was born and raised in with his brothers, his presidential helicopter, his bullet proof limo, etc.  The Nixon family home is really a contrast to how people lived in tiny quarters compared to today's massive homes.  Small house with 2 bedrooms, living area, kitchen, and attic where a family of 6 lived.  Quaint, but functional...The newer buildings house the museum with videos and displays in time sequence of different times of his life and presidency.  Give yourself about 2 hours to do it justice, or just one hour if all you want is pictures and don't plan to read or view the videos :)The Docent's were very helpful and knowledgeable so definitely go with one on the tour.\n",

            "content: I didn't think I'd like the library, but I was impressed with the historical accuracy of the exhibits.  History has literally caught up with me because I was a young adult during Nixon's presidency!  I was surprised to see that the library was erected adjacent to the home that Nixon's father built and where the president was born.  That house is part of the tour, as well as the helicopter that Nixon used.  The library houses an auditorium that plays a half hour \"movie\" about Nixon's life.  It really gives you a different perspective on the type of man that Nixon was.  It showed a \"softer\" side of Nixon and his rises and falls throughout his life.  The Watergate exhibit was the most fascinating of the exhibits based on the large number of people gathered in that area, but my favorite place was the room that housed life-size statues of heads of state and other important figures during Nixon's career.  I got nine out of the eleven correct without looking at their names.  I never realized that Khrushchev was so short and DeGaulle towered over everyone.  I think the library is well worth the visit.\n",

            "content: I was very young when Nixon was President, and I wanted to come to the library to try to remind myself of all of the amazing contributions he made in his years of public service.  I was stunned at the impact Nixon had both as Vice President and President of the United States.    For anyone who remembers, or who never knew, you can marvel as you follow the mueseum's text.    The library was a beautiful place.  When you first get there, you park by a large fountain.  You walk into to the facility and I was told on most days of the week get to see the movie first  (we were there Sunday and on Sunday they show it near the end of the museum.)  The Movie really sums up his accomplishments - I wanted to see it twice.  In the next area, there are videos that show campaign commercials that are from the olden days.  This was quite interesting - so different from now days.  In the next areas, there were a lot of historical photos and facts, with a lot of readings.  There were some kids there and they were very bored.   In my opinion, this isn't a great place for young kids.    As the museum continued you get to see a very cool presidential limo and in that room, the contributions made were summed up.  Amazing.  Then you get to see the birthplace (house), and the helicopter.  Both of these were enjoyable and don't take a lot of time.   A docent takes you into the house and tells you stories.  What I remember most is this -  They said that Nixon learned to play piano on the piano still in the house, and that he taught himself several other instruments.  And then they said that he started learning geography and other information by reading his Uncle's National Geographic Magazines,  when he was done with them.  And in the main entrance,  it talks about how he worked his way through college and then was accepted to get his law degree and earned a scholarship.  What an inspiration.    Imagine that one of our most influential foreign policy presidents started in this tiny house learning about the world any way he could (through magazines), and went on to be a lawyer, and even the President of the United States.  Dare to dream.  So inspiring.\n",

Now, years later I brought my teenage sons.  Of course you get a good deal of history, but what a pleasant surprise to be inspired by the whole experience.  It is amazing to see into the life of a man that shaped not only the history of the United States, but of the world.  And to hear Nixon speak (in the short film about his life) so eloquently about his passion to make a difference in the world, it was very uplifting.  My teens were drawn into the exhibits and they can be pretty tough customers!  Presidential Libraries are simply dazzling by the historical treasures they hold, but also by giving the human story behind the office of President.\n",

Too bad, they finished the Centennial Birthday Celebration by the time we got there.  So, we just managed to see the library and the museum.  It was a nice place to visit.  It was more than just a library that what I was first thought.  The museum was not too big, but it was worth visit.  They even had a piece of Berlin wall in the museum.\n",

I was a late teen/young adult when the Nixon years engulfed the country. He was the first president I voted for. I don’t particularly admire him, but neither do I dislike him. This Library/Museum was fascinating! It had more in it than I could absorb in the scant two hours I was able to be there. Nixon’s early life and his multiple talents are highlighted. On the grounds is the house he was born in, including the bed and an original quilt. This is because after his mother died, the furnishings, etc. were placed in storage, but the house sold. Later when the house was re-acquired, they had all the original items to display. In the museum is a large display on Watergate, not sugarcoated at all. Gorgeous grounds and super gift shop with all kinds of political items, not only those related to Nixon. Nixon and his wife are both buried on the grounds. Tricia Nixon Cox only the day before had placed new flower wreaths at their gravesite.  Go see this place! It’s history.\n",

            "content: Former President Richard M Nixon chose not to have a mock up of the oval office built in his library museum.  However, there was still much of interest to view.Instead of the Oval office, a replica of the Lincoln Sitting Room, Mr. Nixon's favorite room in the White House, was built.  It was the room in which he enjoyed contemplating and making decisions.  Looking into the room, one can imagine Mr. Nixon and Henry Kissinger having one of their conversations about foreign policy.  The museum has memorabilia about Nixon's campaigns and political career.We were there at Christmas and an entire room featured Christmas Trees with decorations from all over the world.Outside the Yorba Linda museum within the paid admission area was Nixon's birthplace home, with the graves of his wife and the former President less than 100 feet away.  The home has been fully restored and features original furnishings and old photographs.  Near the home is the actual helicopter used by Mr. Nixon on the day he left the White House for the final time.The museum and grounds open at 11AM.  Admission is about $13, with plenty of free parking.  We toured the entire 8 acre facility in about 3 hours.  However, a Nixonphile could have stayed for days looking at old videos featuring speeches and other items of interest.  Having been to the Carter, Johnson and Reagan libraries, this one is comparable to the others.  Even if you have seen one, you have NOT seen them all. The staff was extremely pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful.  All guests may have a personally guided tour of the helicopter and childhood home.Regardless of political affiliation, one will easily enjoy visiting this educational facility.\n",

            "content: We decided to visit the Nixon Library sort of on a whim.  We were both teens when the whole Nixon/Watergate scandal happened, so it definitely is a life long memory.  The museum is well done and very interesting.  There are all the usual things one comes to expect in a presidential library/museum, including lots of exhibits of history and memorabilia.  I found particularly interesting all the official gifts on display.  Something I learned from a museum docent is that all these gifts belong to the country if they are valued over a certain amount ($100?).  However, if the president wants a particular gift, he has the option to purchase is from the nation, which, in a few cases, President Nixon did.  One of my favorite exhibits was the helicopter which transported Nixon and his family away from the White House after his resignation.  Of course most people in my generation remember this significant event in history.  I think many, if not most, in my generation thought of Nixon as a dishonest crook.  The museum addresses some of his administration's problems, but certainly puts a positive spin on his time in the presidency.  I wouldn't have expected any different.  Incidentally, the grounds and gardens are beautiful.  In fact, there was a wedding being held outside in the gardens while we visited, which apparently happens frequently.  I'm sure that's a great income producer for the facility.\n",

            "content: This presidential library is unique in that it has the home that the president was born in in it's original spot.  They purchased the surrounding land later for the library.  The small home is interesting to see.  It was especially interesting that it was a \"kit\" purchased by and put together by Nixon's father.  There is a lot to see here.  We started with a free tour conducted by a volunteer.  He was an older gentleman and had lived a lot of Nixon's history, as have we.  Our group was small, just us and a couple with a small child.  He was just giving us a brief overview so we could come back later and look in depth at the displays that we were interested in.  The couple with the child were only with us a short time.  This is really not something that young children would enjoy.  When our guide finished showing us around the main building he took us out to the house.  Another volunteer was there but she already had a family she was showing the building to, so we went on to see the helicopter, where another volunteer was \"in charge\".  We were able to walk around inside of it, while the guide pointed out features and gave us information about it and how it had been used.  When we finished, we went back to the house and were given that tour.  At that point our \"original\" guide bid us farewell.  It's always amazing to see how small the homes were \"back then\", especially when you think of the number of people that lived in them.  After that we walked around the grounds for a bit, saw the graves, then went into a \"temporary exhibit\"  on the \"First Lady\" that was housed in a different wing of the building, off of the lobby.  Pat Nixon was quite a lady.  She was born in a mining camp in Nevada and really was a \"self made woman\".  We found that exhibit very interesting and informative.  At that point it was mid-afternoon and we hadn't had lunch, so we stopped in the little snack area and were pleased to find that had pre-made sandwiches, wraps, and salads in a self serve refrigerated display cabinet.  I selected a turkey wrap for $5.99, which we shared.  It was quite large and really tasty.  The wrap was a fancy green one.  Inside there was a lot of crisp lettuce, turkey and shredded cheese.  After our snack, we went back into the museum to watch the movie.  The theatre was huge.  There were about 8 of us there to watch.   The show lasted about 40 minutes, as I recall.  It was just okay, nothing special.  We then walked back through the exhibits and paused at a few of them, but there was SO much there - you could spend weeks.  They had a whole long sort of hall on Watergate.  We had lived through that once and didn't have time to do it again.  We stopped at an area that had full size statues of the world leaders at the time.  We thought they were fun to look at and walk around.  All throughout there are button to push with short videos, or sometimes just audio explaining in more detail what you're looking at.  There is a large display of the letters he wrote to Pat.  There is a display of the dresses she worn to certain occasions.  We throughly enjoyed our visit there.  After 4 hours, we had to leave.  We still had a 4 hour drive to arrive at our destination for the night.  This is not something children would enjoy at all - unless you have an unusual child.  There is free parking, and a small gift shop as you enter, with \"presidential\" stuff .  Admission is $11.95 for adults, $8.50 for seniors.\n",

The week that we visited there was a special display about Pat Nixon.  I found that to be much more interesting!  There were some moving photos and footage from Pat Nixon's funeral and a great little video of an adult Caroline Kennedy talking about Pat Nixon's graciousness when Jackie Kennedy and the children visited the White House for the first time after JFK's death (maybe 10 years later?)  The gardens are lovely and the Nixon home was an interesting place.  Takes about 3 hours to visit.\n",

However as museums go, there were hardly any interactive learning exhibits - some audio and video, but sparse. Also, the gift shop and snack shop were very small with only a couple tables to sit at. There were also not that many benches throughout the building. The architectural highlight of the museum probably is the replica of the ballroom in the white house.

A bit inspiring to see that a president could come from a small farmhouse.  Even without seeing the library, you could also spend quite a lot of time outside in the rose garden.  They have a wide variety of roses.  Obviously, the best time is May, June but there's always something blooming.  I also enjoyed the recreation of the White House East Room which can be used for wedding receptions.\n",

            "content: Although I live but a few miles from the Nixon Library I had never taken advantage of the opportunity to visit until recently.  My daughter, who is a history teacher, son-in-law and I, also an educator, visited on a recent Sunday.  The Library is beautiful!  The documentation and history are simply phenomenal!  The gardens are lovely.  One could spend hours reading and browsing the various memorabilia that has been preserved at the Library.  I do not recommend a docent tour.  We started out with a docent who wanted to hear himself talk and labored over some of the less important displays and rushed through some that were very important during the Nixon Presidency.  He seemed unaware that many on his tour were breaking off and doing their own thing, not listening to his speech and that he was pretty much talking to himself.  The same was true of the docent who took us into the house where Nixon grew up.  He rambled and everyone was getting antsy by the time he let us out.  That was not true of the helicopter.  This docent knew a great deal about the helicopter, was able to answer questions such as why it is now called \"Marine One,\" yet inside it states it is \"Army One.\"  He was enthusiastic about telling the story behind the helicopter and knew the facts relating to it.  While we spent about 3 hours wandering and reading and enjoying, there was so much more to see.  We will definitely return to spend more time enjoying the wonderful displays.  The displays relating to the Cold War, Vietnam, China and Watergate were absolutely great, as was the entire Library.  It is worth everyone's time to visit and learn a little about the history of a man who failed onn the domestic front but was a huge success on the diplomatic and foreign policy front!\n",

There are so many delightful exhibits, especially the letters from children when he lost his first presidential run as well as the room full of gifts from foreign nations.

The Library is now a part of the National Archives.  The foundation had worked hard to present Nixon in a most favorable light, and so, everything in the gallery presented Nixon as a wonderful man who did wonderful things and left the world a more wonderful place.  Now that the National Archives has taken over the library, a real historian and librarian has been brought in to rework the gallery presentations, so that they more accurately reflect the history.  Is it better?  Yes.  Is there a lot of work to be done?  Yes.  The most immediate changes came in the gallery covering Watergate.  There is a very interesting, even handed presentation of the events leading up to Nixon's resignation.  But in other areas of the library, some of the material is truly disturbing.  For example, in the gallery on Vietnam, the narrative states that Democrats aided and gave comfort to Hanoi.  That is just plain wrong, historically inaccurate and lopsided.  The grounds are beautiful, the building is gorgeous, and there are some cool artifacts, like space suits and astronaut food.  But historically, they still have a lot of work to do.\n",

Kennedy (including interesting facts about the famous debates), two successful presidential elections (including a historic landside victory) and his eventful and remarkable Presidency marked by the end of the Vietnam War, diplomacy with China, The Cold War and many other things.And yes the Watergate situation and extraordinary media furor surrounding it is comprehensibly covered and presented including an exhibit which includes the actual tape recorder used in the infamous 18 minute gap incident.President Nixon’s and Mrs. Patricia Nixon’s gravesite are on the perfectly manicured grounds as is the home that the President was born.The Library and Museum are located in Yorba Linda, not far from Anaheim.If would you want to be real adventurous, you may wish to go for a Presidential Double Header and attempt to visit the Ronald Reagan Library and Museum located in Simi Valley the same day!\n",

This may account for the not merely sympathetic, but petulant tone of some of the existing exhibit commentaries (sad in contrast with other Pres. Libraries) This flaw aside, the museum is well wotth visiting especially for the insights into Nixon's foreign policy efforts. The weather is usually beautiful so you can leave that Republican Cloth Coat at home.\n",

            "content: Nixon had his problems and failings, but this memorial to him does a great job of bringing out his good qualities (intelligence, energy, vision, and - yes - statesmanship), and reminds us, in an age of poll-driven, over-managed, look-alike political leaders few of whom seem capable of sustained thought or discourse, what a truly interesting, articulate, and quintessential American Nixon was. The setting is beautiful, and the birthplace itself - that is, the house in which Nixon was born, which sits right where it always has - is a fascinating glimpse into an age when hardworking people bettered their lives as they transformed Southern California from a sleepy agricultural region to the great megapolis it is today. Well worth a visit if you're at all interested in 20th Century American history and politics, especially if your idea of fun is to watch the \"Checkers\" speech on a vintage 1952 TV.\n",
